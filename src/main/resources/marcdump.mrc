The widespread practice of polygyny is one feature of many sub-Saharan African contexts that may be relevant to understanding patterns of infant mortality. Building on evidence that the prevalence of polygyny reflects broader economic, social, and cultural features and that it has implications for how families engage in the practice, we investigate whether and how the prevalence of polygyny (1) spills over to elevate infant mortality for all families, and (2) conditions the survival disadvantage for children living in polygynous families (i.e., compared with monogamous families). We use data from Demographic and Health Surveys to estimate multilevel hazard models that identify associations between infant mortality and region-level prevalence of polygyny for 236,336 children in 260 subnational regions across 29 sub-Saharan African countries. We find little evidence that the prevalence of polygyny influences mortality for infants in nonpolygynous households net of region-level socioeconomic factors and gender inequality. However, the prevalence of polygyny significantly amplifies the survival disadvantage for infants in polygynous families. Our findings demonstrate that considering the broader marital context reveals important insights into the relationship between family structure and child well-being. 4aEquity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement         b(D63) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSub-Saharan Africa  aChild  a Children  a Demographics  a Families  a Family  a Gender  a Health  a Inequality  a Infants  a Marital  a Mortality  a Polygyny  a Well Being  a Well-being  aJournal Article  g51g2h341-66tDemography  iN  aApril 201402304naa  2200493   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002240430008002322450079002401000025003197000026003441100029003707100015003995200759004146500067011736500052012406500038012926500073013306500065014036500076014686500066015446530011016106530015016216530012016366530013016486530018016616530015016796530011016946530015017056530019017206550020017397730030017598560006017899030015017951428752  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0274-5  aH52  aI11  aI12  aI18  aI20  aJ13  aJ1610aSaving Babies: The Impact of Public Education Programs on Infant Mortality10aMoehling, Carolyn M.10aThomasson, Melissa A.  aRutgers U, New Brunswick  aMiami U OH  aWe take advantage of unique data on specific activities conducted under the Sheppard-Towner Act from 1924 through 1929 to focus on how public health interventions affected infant mortality. Interventions that provided one-on-one contact and opportunities for follow-up care, such as home visits by nurses and the establishment of health clinics, reduced infant deaths more than did classes and conferences. These interventions were particularly effective for nonwhites, a population with limited access to physicians and medical care. Although limited data on costs prevent us from making systematic cost-benefit calculations, we estimate that one infant death could be avoided for every $1,600 (about $20,400 in 2010 dollars) spent on home nurse visits. 4aNational Government Expenditures and Education         b(H52) 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18) 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aDeaths  a Education  a Health  a Infants  a Medical Care  a Mortality  a Nurse  a Physician  a Public Health  aJournal Article  g51g2h367-86tDemography  iN  aApril 201402939naa  2200457   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002082450147002161000026003637000018003897000021004077000021004287000019004491100015004687100016004837100059004997100031005587100016005895201435006056500038020406500076020786500066021546500109022206510012023296530011023416530018023526530012023706530012023826530015023946550020024097730031024298560006024609030015024661428753  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0268-3  aI12  aJ13  aJ16  aO1510aReporting Errors in Siblings' Survival Histories and Their Impact on Adult Mortality Estimates: Results from a Record Linkage Study in Senegal10aHelleringer, Stephane10aPison, Gilles10aKante, Almamy M.10aDuthe, Geraldine10aAndro, Armelle  aColumbia U  aINED, Paris  aColumbia U and Ifakara Health Institute, Dar es Salaam  aColumbia U and INED, Paris  aINED, Paris  aEstimates of adult mortality in countries with limited vital registration (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa) are often derived from information about the survival of a respondent's siblings. We evaluated the completeness and accuracy of such data through a record linkage study conducted in Bandafassi, located in southeastern Senegal. We linked at the individual level retrospective siblings' survival histories (SSH) reported by female respondents (n = 268) to prospective mortality data and genealogies collected through a health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS). Respondents often reported inaccurate lists of siblings. Additions to these lists were uncommon, but omissions were frequent: respondents omitted 3.8% of their live sisters, 9.1% of their deceased sisters, and 16.6% of their sisters who had migrated out of the DSS area. Respondents underestimated the age at death of the siblings they reported during the interview, particularly among siblings who had died at older ages (>=45 years). Restricting SSH data to person-years and events having occurred during a recent reference period reduced list errors but not age and date errors. Overall, SSH data led to a 20% underestimate of [subscript 45] q[subscript 15] relative to HDSS data. Our study suggests new quality improvement strategies for SSH data and demonstrates the potential use of HDSS data for the validation of "unconventional" demographic techniques. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSenegal  aDeaths  a Demographics  a Female  a Health  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g51g2h387-411tDemography  iN  aApril 201402696naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002082450105002161000027003217000021003481100027003697100009003965201506004056500038019116500065019496500042020146500076020566510009021326530014021416530016021556530015021716530012021866530015021986530014022136550020022277730030022478560006022779030015022831428754  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0261-x  aI12  aI20  aI21  aJ1310aCumulative Childhood Adversity, Educational Attainment, and Active Life Expectancy among U.S. Adults10aMontez, Jennifer Karas10aHayward, Mark D.  aCase Western Reserve U  aU TX  aStudies of the early-life origins of adult physical functioning and mortality have found that childhood health and socioeconomic context are important predictors, often irrespective of adult experiences. However, these studies have generally assessed functioning and mortality as distinct processes and used cross-sectional prevalence estimates that neglect the interplay of disability incidence, recovery, and mortality. Here, we examine whether early-life disadvantages both shorten lives and increase the number and fraction of years lived with functional impairment. We also examine the degree to which educational attainment mediates and moderates the health consequences of early-life disadvantages. Using the 1998-2008 Health and Retirement Study, we examine these questions for non-Hispanic whites and blacks aged 50-100 years using multistate life tables. Within levels of educational attainment, adults from disadvantaged childhoods lived fewer total and active years, and spent a greater portion of life impaired compared with adults from advantaged childhoods. Higher levels of education did not ameliorate the health consequences of disadvantaged childhoods. However, because education had a larger impact on health than did childhood socioeconomic context, adults from disadvantaged childhoods who achieved high education levels often had total and active life expectancies that were similar to or better than those of adults from advantaged childhoods who achieved low education levels. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildhood  a Disability  a Education  a Health  a Mortality  a Recovery  aJournal Article  g51g2h413-35tDemography  iN  aApril 201402939naa  2200553   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002240430008002322450093002401000018003337000027003517000022003787000019004001100023004197100011004427100028004537100011004815201223004926500038017156500042017536500048017956500084018436500076019276500109020036500063021126510014021756530010021896530014021996530012022136530015022256530014022406530012022546530016022666530016022826530016022986550020023147730030023348560006023649030015023701428755  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-014-0279-8  aI12  aI21  aI31  aJ12  aJ13  aO15  aQ5413aThe Impact of Parental Death on Child Well-Being: Evidence from the Indian Ocean Tsunami10aCas, Ava Gail10aFrankenberg, Elizabeth10aSuriastini, Wayan10aThomas, Duncan  aCatholic U America  aDuke U  aSurveyMETER, Yogyakarta  aDuke U  aIdentifying the impact of parental death on the well-being of children is complicated because parental death is likely to be correlated with other, unobserved factors that affect child well-being. Population-representative longitudinal data collected in Aceh, Indonesia, before and after the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami are used to identify the impact of parental deaths on the well-being of children aged 9-17 at the time of the tsunami. Exploiting the unanticipated nature of parental death resulting from the tsunami in combination with measuring well-being of the same children before and after the tsunami, models that include child fixed effects are estimated to isolate the causal effect of parental death. Comparisons are drawn between children who lost one or both parents and children whose parents survived. Shorter-term impacts on school attendance and time allocation one year after the tsunami are examined, as well as longer-term impacts on education trajectories and marriage. Shorter- and longer-term impacts are not the same. Five years after the tsunami, there are substantial deleterious impacts of the tsunami on older boys and girls, whereas the effects on younger children are more muted. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aClimate; Natural Disasters; Global Warming         b(Q54)  aIndonesia  aChild  a Children  a Deaths  a Education  a Marriage  a Parent  a Population  a Well Being  a Well-being  aJournal Article  g51g2h437-57tDemography  iN  aApril 201402285naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002162450078002241000020003027000028003227000019003507000022003691100037003917100037004287100037004657100037005025200829005396500094013686500052014626500038015146500084015526500076016366510009017126530010017216530014017316530012017456530011017576550020017687730030017888560006018189030015018241428756  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0258-5  aD63  aI11  aI12  aJ12  aJ1310aChanges in Young Children's Family Structures and Child Care Arrangements10aCrosnoe, Robert10aPrickett, Kate Chambers10aSmith, Chelsea10aCavanagh, Shannon  aPopulation Research Center, U TX  aPopulation Research Center, U TX  aPopulation Research Center, U TX  aPopulation Research Center, U TX  aFamily structure change can disrupt the settings of children's daily lives. Most scholarship focuses on disruption in the home environment. Moving beyond the home, this study explores the association between changes in family structure and changes in several dimensions of early child care. With longitudinal data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (n = 1,298), first-difference models reveal that family structure transitions are associated with changes in the type and quantity of early care as well as the number of care arrangements used, especially during the latter part of infancy. Given prior evidence linking these child care dimensions to behavioral and cognitive outcomes, these results suggest a policy-relevant mechanism by which family change may create inequalities among children. 4aEquity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement         b(D63) 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Family  a Youth  aJournal Article  g51g2h459-83tDemography  iN  aApril 201403052naa  2200541   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002240430008002322450089002401000023003297000021003527000020003737000015003937000016004081100016004247100022004407100009004627100033004717100033005045201275005376500110018126500065019226500062019876500048020496500084020976500076021816500066022576510036023236530010023596530018023696530014023876530013024016530013024146530011024276550020024387730031024588560006024899030015024951428757  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0273-6  aD72  aI20  aI30  aI31  aJ12  aJ13  aJ1610aChildbearing across Partnerships in Australia, the United States, Norway, and Sweden10aThomson, Elizabeth10aLappegard, Trude10aCarlson, Marcia10aEvans, Ann10aGray, Edith  aStockholm U  aStatistics Norway  aU WI  aADSRI, Australian National U  aADSRI, Australian National U  aThis article compares mothers' experience of having children with more than one partner in two liberal welfare regimes (the United States and Australia) and two social democratic regimes (Sweden and Norway). We use survey-based union and birth histories in Australia and the United States and data from national population registers in Norway and Sweden to estimate the likelihood of experiencing childbearing across partnerships at any point in the childbearing career. We find that births with new partners constitute a substantial proportion of all births in each country we study. Despite quite different arrangements for social welfare, the determinants of childbearing across partnerships are very similar. Women who had their first birth at a very young age or who are less well-educated are most likely to have children with different partners. The educational gradient in childbearing across partnerships is also consistently negative across countries, particularly in contrast to educational gradients in childbearing with the same partner. The risk of childbearing across partnerships increased dramatically in all countries from the 1980s to the 2000s, and educational differences also increased, again, in both liberal and social democratic welfare regimes. 4aPolitical Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior         b(D72) 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: General         b(I30) 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aAustralia; Norway; Sweden; U.S.  aBirth  a Childbearing  a Children  a Mothers  a Welfare  a Women  aJournal Article  g51g2h485-508tDemography  iN  aApril 201402421naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002002450087002081000019002957000020003147000023003347000019003571100020003767100020003967100009004167100049004255201264004746500084017386500076018226500066018986530010019646530014019746550020019887730030020088560006020389030015020441428758  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0267-4  aJ12  aJ13  aJ1610aBirth Cohort and the Specialization Gap between Same-Sex and Different-Sex Couples10aGiddings, Lisa10aNunley, John M.10aSchneebaum, Alyssa10aZietz, Joachim  aU WI, La Crosse  aU WI, La Crosse  aU MA  aMiddle TN State U and EBS U Business and Law  aWe examine differences in household specialization between same-sex and different-sex couples within and across three birth cohorts: Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Generation Y. Using three measures of household specialization, we find that same-sex couples are less likely than their different-sex counterparts to exhibit a high degree of specialization. However, the "specialization gap" between same-sex and different-sex couples narrows across birth cohorts. These findings are indicative of a cohort effect. Our results are largely robust to the inclusion of a control for the presence of children and for subsets of couples with and without children. We provide three potential explanations for why the specialization gap narrows across cohorts. First, different-sex couples from more recent birth cohorts may have become more like same-sex couples in terms of household specialization. Second, social and legal changes may have prompted a greater degree of specialization within same-sex couples relative to different-sex couples. Last, the advent of reproductive technologies, which made having children easier for same-sex couples from more recent birth cohorts, could result in more specialization in such couples relative to different-sex couples. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aBirth  a Children  aJournal Article  g51g2h509-34tDemography  iN  aApril 201403014naa  2200613   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002162450101002241000022003257000025003477000018003727000019003901100012004097100012004217100013004337100012004465201255004586500038017136500048017516500076017996500066018756500109019416510009020506530010020596530018020696530014020876530018021016530021021196530015021406530012021556530012021676530017021796530016021966530018022126530015022306530015022456530010022606530016022706530016022866530016023026530011023186550020023297730030023498560006023799030015023851428759  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-014-0282-0  aI12  aI31  aJ13  aJ16  aO1510aFertility Decline, Girls' Well-Being, and Gender Gaps in Children's Well-Being in Poor Countries10aYount, Kathryn M.20aZureick-Brown, Sarah10aHalim, Nafisa10aLaVilla, Kayla  aEmory U  aEmory U  aBoston U  aEmory U  aThe influences of recent dramatic declines in fertility on girls' and boys' well-being in poorer countries are understudied. In panels of 67-75 poorer countries, using 152-185 Demographic and Health Surveys spanning 1985-2008, we examined how declining total fertility and women's increasing median age at first birth were associated with changes in girls' well-being and gender gaps in children's well-being, as reflected in their survival, nutrition, and access to preventive healthcare. In adjusted random-effects models, these changes in fertility were associated with gains in girls' survival at ages 1-4 years, vaccination coverage at ages 12-23 months, and nutrition at 0-36 months (for women's later first childbearing). Declining total fertility was associated with similar gains for boys and girls with respect to vaccination coverage but intensified gender gaps in mortality at ages 1-4 years and malnutrition at ages 0-36 months, especially in higher-son-preference populations. Later increases in women's median age at first birth--reflecting more equitable gender norms--were associated with declines in these gaps. Promoting equitable investments in children through family planning programs in higher-fertility societies is warranted. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aLDCs  aBirth  a Childbearing  a Children  a Demographics  a Family Planning  a Fertility  a Gender  a Health  a Health Care  a Healthcare  a Malnutrition  a Mortality  a Nutrition  a Poor  a Population  a Well Being  a Well-being  a Women  aJournal Article  g51g2h535-61tDemography  iN  aApril 201401862naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002082450112002161000022003281100048003505200754003986500084011526500066012366500057013026500044013596510009014036530008014126530014014206530019014346550020014537730030014738560006015039030015015091428760  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0277-2  aJ12  aJ16  aJ18  aK3613aThe Death of Marriage?

This article examines how changes in U.S. legal recognition laws occurring between 1995 and 2010 designed to include same-sex couples have altered marriage rates in the United States. Using a difference-in-differences strategy that compares how marriage rates change after legal recognition in U.S. states that alter legal recognition versus states that do not, I find no evidence that allowing same-sex couples to marry reduces the opposite-sex marriage rate. Although the opposite-sex marriage rate is unaffected by same-sex couples marrying, it decreases when domestic partnerships are available to opposite-sex couples. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aDemographic Economics: Public Policy         b(J18) 4aFamily and Personal Law         b(K36)  aU.S.  aLaw  a Marriage  a Marriage Rate  aJournal Article  g51g2h563-85tDemography  iN  aApril 201401947naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001922450086002001000020002867000020003061100028003267100028003545201004003826500084013866500044014706510009015146530012015236530013015356530014015486550020015627730030015828560006016129030015016181428761  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0270-9  aJ12  aK3610aBreaking Up Is Hard to Count: The Rise of Divorce in the United States, 1980-201010aKennedy, Sheela10aRuggles, Steven  aPopulation Center, U MN  aPopulation Center, U MN  aThis article critically evaluates the available data on trends in divorce in the United States. We find that both vital statistics and retrospective survey data on divorce after 1990 underestimate recent marital instability. These flawed data have led some analysts to conclude that divorce has been stable or declining for the past three decades. Using new data from the American Community Survey and controlling for changes in the age composition of the married population, we conclude that there was actually a substantial increase in age-standardized divorce rates between 1990 and 2008. Divorce rates have doubled over the past two decades among persons over age 35. Among the youngest couples, however, divorce rates are stable or declining. If current trends continue, overall age-standardized divorce rates could level off or even decline over the next few decades. We argue that the leveling of divorce among persons born since 1980 probably reflects the increasing selectivity of marriage. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFamily and Personal Law         b(K36)  aU.S.  aDivorce  a Marital  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g51g2h587-98tDemography  iN  aApril 201402566naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002242450083002321000015003157000012003301100009003427100081003515201025004326500042014576500084014996500076015836500108016596500109017676500155018766510010020316530013020416530015020546530015020696550020020847730031021048560006021359030015021411428762  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0275-4  aI21  aJ12  aJ13  aJ14  aO15  aP3613aThe Effects of Grandparents on Children's Schooling: Evidence from Rural China10aZeng, Zhen10aXie, Yu  aU WI  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI and Center for Social Research, Peking u  aThe issue of whether the social class of grandparents affects grandchildren's socioeconomic outcomes net of the characteristics of the middle generation is much debated in the social mobility literature. Using data from the 2002 Chinese Household Income Project, we investigate the direct effects of grandparents on grandchildren's educational attainment in rural China. We find that the influence of grandparents is contingent on living arrangements. Although the educational level of coresident grandparents directly affects the educational attainment of their grandchildren, with an effect size similar to that of parental education, the education of noncoresident and deceased grandparents does not have any effect. These findings suggest that grandparents can directly affect grandchildren's educational outcomes through sociopsychological pathways. Our study not only adds an important case study to the literature but also sheds new light on theoretical interpretations of grandparent effects when they are found. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36)  aChina  aChildren  a Education  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g51g2h599-617tDemography  iN  aApril 201401954naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001922450087002001000023002877000021003107000025003311100041003567100021003977100041004185200863004596500042013226500108013646510032014726530011015046530015015156530015015306550020015457730030015658560006015959030015016011428763  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-014-0281-1  aI21  aJ1410aDoes Education Improve Cognitive Performance Four Decades after School Completion?10aSchneeweis, Nicole10aSkirbekk, Vegard20aWinter-Ebmer, Rudolf  aJohannes Kepler U Linz and IZA, Bonn  aIIASA, Laxenburg  aJohannes Kepler U Linz and IZA, Bonn  aWe study the effect of secondary education on cognitive performance toward the end of working age. We exploit the exogenous variation in years of schooling arising from compulsory schooling reforms implemented in six European countries during the 1950s and 1960s. Using data of individuals, approximately age 60, from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we assess the causal effect of education on memory, fluency, numeracy, and orientation-to-date. Furthermore, we study education effects on cognitive decline. We find a positive impact of schooling on memory scores. One year of education increases the memory score approximately four decades later by about 0.2, which amounts to 10% of a standard deviation. Furthermore, we find some evidence for a protective effect of schooling on cognitive decline in terms of verbal fluency. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aSelected European Countries  aAgeing  a Education  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g51g2h619-43tDemography  iN  aApril 201402317naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002082450073002161000022002891100011003115201208003226500084015306500113016146500065017276500041017926510011018336530009018446530015018536530017018686530011018856550020018967730030019168560006019469030015019521428764  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0271-8  aJ12  aJ15  aJ61  aJ7110aFactors Shaping Workplace Segregation between Natives and Immigrants10aStromgren, Magnus  aUmea U  aResearch on segregation of immigrant groups is increasingly turning its attention from residential areas toward other important places, such as the workplace, where immigrants can meet and interact with members of the native population. This article examines workplace segregation of immigrants. We use longitudinal, georeferenced Swedish population register data, which enables us to observe all immigrants in Sweden for the period 1990-2005 on an annual basis. We compare estimates from ordinary least squares with fixed-effects regressions to quantify the extent of immigrants' self-selection into specific workplaces, neighborhoods, and partnerships, which may bias more naive ordinary least squares results. In line with previous research, we find lower levels of workplace segregation than residential segregation. The main finding is that low levels of residential segregation reduce workplace segregation, even after we take into account intermarriage with natives as well as unobserved characteristics of immigrants' such as willingness and ability to integrate into the host society. Being intermarried with a native reduces workplace segregation for immigrant men but not for immigrant women. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71)  aSweden  aBias  a Immigrant  a Segregation  a Women  aJournal Article  g51g2h645-71tDemography  iN  aApril 201402741naa  2200481   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002240430008002322450102002401000017003421100014003595200956003736500069013296500032013986500113014306500109015436500119016526500095017716500172018666510013020386530017020516530017020686530015020856530010021006530017021106530011021276530013021386530012021516530025021636550020021887730030022088560006022389030015022441428765  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0260-y  aD31  aF24  aJ15  aO15  aO18  aO19  aR2313aThe Impact of Migration and Remittances on Wealth Accumulation and Distribution in Rural Thailand10aGarip, Filiz  aHarvard U  aThis article studies the impact of internal migration and remittance flows on wealth accumulation and distribution in 51 rural villages in Nang Rong, Thailand. Using data from 5,449 households, the study constructs indices of household productive and consumer assets with principal component analysis. The changes in these indices from 1994 to 2000 are modeled as a function of households' prior migration and remittance behavior with ordinary least squares, matching, and instrumental variable methods. The findings show that rich households lose productive assets with migration, potentially because of a reduction in the labor force available to maintain local economic activities, while poor households gain productive assets. Regardless of wealth status, households do not gain or lose consumer assets with migration or remittances. These results suggest an equalizing effect of migration and remittances on wealth distribution in rural Thailand. 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aRemittances         b(F24) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aInternational Linkages to Development; Role of International Organizations         b(O19) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aThailand  aDistribution  a Labor Force  a Migration  a Poor  a Remittances  a Rural  a Village  a Wealth  a Wealth Distribution  aJournal Article  g51g2h673-98tDemography  iN  aApril 201402682naa  2200469   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002162450134002241000023003587000019003817000024004007000022004241100015004467100017004617100013004787100015004915201106005066500076016126500113016886500066018016500065018676500109019326510017020416530010020586530014020686530015020826530015020976530016021126530012021286550020021407730031021608560006021919030015021971428766  a201404       201404                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-014-0280-2  aJ13  aJ15  aJ16  aJ61  aO1510aRecent Trends in Coverage of the Mexican-Born Population of the United States: Results from Applying Multiple Methods across Time10aVan Hook, Jennifer10aBean, Frank D.10aBachmeier, James D.10aTucker, Catherine  aPA State U  aU CA, Irvine  aTemple U  aPA State U  aThe accuracy of counts of U.S. racial/ethnic and immigrant groups depends on the coverage of the foreign-born in official data. Because Mexicans constitute by far the largest single national-origin group among the foreign-born in the United States, we compile new evidence about the coverage of the Mexican-born population in the 2000 census and 2001-2010 American Community Survey (ACS) using three techniques: a death registration, a birth registration, and a net migration method. For the late 1990s and first half of the 2000-2010 decade, results indicate that coverage error was somewhat higher than currently assumed but had substantially declined by the latter half of the 2000-2010 decade. Additionally, we find evidence that U.S. census and ACS data miss substantial numbers of children of Mexican immigrants, as well as people who are most likely to be unauthorized: namely, working-aged Mexican immigrants (ages 15-64), especially males. The findings highlight the heterogeneity of the Mexican foreign-born population and the ways in which migration dynamics may affect population coverage. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMexico; U.S.  aBirth  a Children  a Immigrant  a Migration  a Population  a Racial  aJournal Article  g51g2h699-726tDemography  iN  aApril 201400575naa  2200205   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001842450034001921000021002261100009002476500042002566550020002987730027003188560006003459030018003511434055  a201405       201402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0276-3  aY2011aA Message from the New Editor10aSmock, Pamela J.  aU MI 4aIntroductory Material         b(Y20)  aJournal Article  g51g1h1-2tDemography  iN  aFebruary 201402107naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001922450076002001000027002761100009003035201144003126500084014566500098015406510009016386530013016476530013016606530018016736530016016916530014017076550020017217730028017418560006017699030018017751434056  a201405       201402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0257-6  aJ12  aZ1310aCulture and Demography: From Reluctant Bedfellows to Committed Partners10aBachrach, Christine A.  aU MD  aDemography and culture have had a long but ambivalent relationship. Cultural influences are widely recognized as important for demographic outcomes but are often "backgrounded" in demographic research. I argue that progress toward a more successful integration is feasible and suggest a network model of culture as a potential tool. The network model bridges both traditional (holistic and institutional) and contemporary (tool kit) models of culture used in the social sciences and offers a simple vocabulary for a diverse set of cultural concepts, such as attitudes, beliefs, and norms, as well as quantitative measures of how culture is organized. The proposed model conceptualizes culture as a nested network of meanings represented by schemas that range in complexity from simple concepts to multifaceted cultural models. I illustrate the potential value of a model using accounts of the cultural changes underpinning the transformation of marriage in the United States and point to developments in the social, cognitive, and computational sciences that could facilitate the application of the model in empirical demographic research. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aU.S.  aCultural  a Culture  a Demographics  a Demography  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g51g1h3-25tDemography  iN  aFebruary 201402414naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001922450107002001000023003077000019003307000019003497000016003681100036003847100036004207100012004567100036004685201230005046500059017346500038017936510009018316530011018406530012018516530012018636530015018756530015018906530013019056530013019186550020019317730029019518560006019809030018019861434057  a201405       201402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0246-9  aC53  aI1210aProjecting the Effect of Changes in Smoking and Obesity on Future Life Expectancy in the United States10aPreston, Samuel H.10aStokes, Andrew10aMehta, Neil K.10aCao, Bochen  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aEmory U  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aWe estimate the effects of declining smoking and increasing obesity on mortality in the United States over the period 2010-2040. Data on cohort behavioral histories are integrated into these estimates. Future distributions of body mass indices are projected using transition matrices applied to the initial distribution in 2010. In addition to projections of current obesity, we project distributions of obesity when cohorts are age 25. To these distributions, we apply death rates by current and age-25 obesity status observed in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-2006. Estimates of the effects of smoking changes are based on observed relations between cohort smoking patterns and cohort death rates from lung cancer. We find that changes in both smoking and obesity are expected to have large effects on U.S. mortality. For males, the reductions in smoking have larger effects than the rise in obesity throughout the projection period. By 2040, male life expectancy at age 40 is expected to have gained 0.83 years from the combined effects. Among women, however, the two sets of effects largely offset one another throughout the projection period, with a small gain of 0.09 years expected by 2040. 4aForecasting Models; Simulation Methods         b(C53) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aCancer  a Deaths  a Health  a Mortality  a Nutrition  a Obesity  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g51g1h27-49tDemography  iN  aFebruary 201402057naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001922450100002001000029003001100009003295201218003386500094015566500038016506530015016886530015017036550020017187730029017388560006017679030018017731434058  a201405       201402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0256-7  aD63  aI1210aMortality Deceleration and Mortality Selection: Three Unexpected Implications of a Simple Model20aWrigley-Field, Elizabeth  aU WI  aUnobserved heterogeneity in mortality risk is pervasive and consequential. Mortality deceleration--the slowing of mortality's rise with age--has been considered an important window into heterogeneity that otherwise might be impossible to explore. In this article, I argue that deceleration patterns may reveal surprisingly little about the heterogeneity that putatively produces them. I show that even in a very simple model--one that is composed of just two subpopulations with Gompertz mortality--(1) aggregate mortality can decelerate even while a majority of the cohort is frail; (2) multiple decelerations are possible; and (3) mortality selection can produce acceleration as well as deceleration. Simulations show that these patterns are plausible in model cohorts that in the aggregate resemble cohorts in the Human Mortality Database. I argue that these results challenge some conventional heuristics for understanding the relationship between selection and deceleration; undermine certain inferences from deceleration timing to patterns of social inequality; and imply that standard parametric models, assumed to plateau at most once, may sometimes badly misestimate deceleration timing--even by decades. 4aEquity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement         b(D63) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aInequality  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g51g1h51-71tDemography  iN  aFebruary 201402408naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001842450083001921000026002757000023003017000020003241100059003447100015004037100053004185201461004716500038019326510012019706530011019826530013019936530015020066550020020217730029020418560006020709030018020761434059  a201405       201402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0253-x  aI1210aLifespan Variation by Occupational Class: Compression or Stagnation over Time?10avan Raalte, Alyson A.10aMartikainen, Pekka10aMyrskyla, Mikko  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock  aU Helsinki  aLondon School of Economics and Political Science  aCross-sectional analyses of adult lifespan variation have found an inverse association between socioeconomic position and lifespan variation, but the trends by social class are unknown. We investigated trends in lifespan variation over four decades (1971-2010) by occupational social class (manual, lower nonmanual, upper nonmanual, other) using Finnish register data. We performed age and cause-of-death decompositions of lifespan variation for each sex (a) by occupational class over time and (b) between occupational classes at a shared level of life expectancy. Although life expectancy increased in all classes, lifespan variation was stable among manual workers and decreased only among nonmanual classes. These differences were caused by early-adult mortality: older-age lifespan variation declined for all the classes, but variation in early-adult mortality increased for all classes except the highest. The manual class's high and stagnant lifespan variation was driven by declines in circulatory diseases that were equally spread over early mortality-compressing and older mortality-expanding ages, as well as by high early-adult mortality from external causes. Results were similar for men and women. The results of this study, which is the first to document trends in lifespan variation by social class, suggest that mortality compression is compatible with increasing life expectancy but currently achieved only by higher occupational classes. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aFinland  aDeaths  a Disease  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g51g1h73-95tDemography  iN  aFebruary 201402822naa  2200505   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002240430008002322450036002401000022002767000013002987000015003117000020003261100015003467100047003617100047004087100047004555200970005026500056014726500038015286500108015666500109016746500119017836500103019026500155020056510010021606530015021706530014021856530011021996530021022106530011022316550020022427730030022628560006022929030018022981434060  a201405       201402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0272-7  aH55  aI12  aJ14  aO15  aO18  aP25  aP3613aThe Cost of Disability in China10aLoyalka, Prashant10aLiu, Lan10aChen, Gong10aZheng, Xiaoying  aStanford U  aInstitute of Population Research, Peking U  aInstitute of Population Research, Peking U  aInstitute of Population Research, Peking U  aWe describe the degree to which household income is negatively associated with the prevalence of different types of disability (i.e., medical impairments) in China using data from the 2006 Second National Survey of Disabled Persons. We then calculate the extra costs of disability across different types of households and show how these costs differ by the type and severity of disability in both urban and rural areas. Finally, we use nationally representative panel data on persons with disabilities from 2007 to 2009 to examine the degree to which social security is reaching persons with different types and severity of disabilities in both urban and rural areas. We conclude that although the amount and coverage of social security for households with disabilities is increasing rapidly, it is still not enough to offset the income differential between households with and without disabled persons, especially when we account for the extra costs of disability. 4aSocial Security and Public Pensions         b(H55) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Urban, Rural, and Regional Economics         b(P25) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36)  aChina  aDisability  a Disabled  a Rural  a Social Security  a Urban  aJournal Article  g51g1h97-118tDemography  iN  aFebruary 201402299naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001922450124002001000023003247000026003477000022003737000025003957000028004207000024004481100009004727100042004817100009005237100044005327100009005767100009005855201095005946500038016896500065017276510009017926530014018016530012018156550020018277730030018478560006018779030018018831434061  a201405       201402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0259-4  aI12  aI2010aIs the Gene-Environment Interaction Paradigm Relevant to Genome-Wide Studies?

We use completed college education as our environmental measure and estimate the interactive effect of genotype and education on body mass index (BMI) using 260,402 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our results highlight the sensitivity of parameter estimates obtained from GWAS models and the difficulty of framing genome-wide results using the existing gene-environment interaction typology. We argue that SNP-environment interactions across the human genome are not likely to provide consistent evidence regarding genetic influences on health that differ by environment. Nevertheless, genome-wide data contain rich information about individual respondents, and we demonstrate the utility of this type of data. We highlight the fact that GWAS is just one use of genome-wide data, and we encourage demographers to develop methods that incorporate this vast amount of information from respondents into their analyses. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20)  aU.S.  aEducation  a Health  aJournal Article  g51g1h119-39tDemography  iN  aFebruary 201402138naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002002450126002081000015003347000014003497000016003637000016003797000028003957000011004231100009004347100009004437100009004527100012004617100009004737100009004825200857004916500053013486500113014016500098015146510009016126530009016216530012016306550020016427730030016628560006016929030018016981434062  a201405       201402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0242-0  aC83  aJ15  aZ1310aGenetic Bio-ancestry and Social Construction of Racial Classification in Social Surveys in the Contemporary United States10aGuo, Guang10aFu, Yilan10aLee, Hedwig10aCai, Tianji10aMullan Harris, Kathleen10aLi, Yi  aU NC  aU NC  aU WA  aU Macau  aU NC  aU NC  aSelf-reported race is generally considered the basis for racial classification in social surveys, including the U.S. census. Drawing on recent advances in human molecular genetics and social science perspectives of socially constructed race, our study takes into account both genetic bio-ancestry and social context in understanding racial classification. This article accomplishes two objectives. First, our research establishes geographic genetic bio-ancestry as a component of racial classification. Second, it shows how social forces trump biology in racial classification and/or how social context interacts with bio-ancestry in shaping racial classification. The findings were replicated in two racially and ethnically diverse data sets: the College Roommate Study (N = 2,065) and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 2,281). 4aSurvey Methods; Sampling Methods         b(C83) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aU.S.  aRace  a Racial  aJournal Article  g51g1h141-72tDemography  iN  aFebruary 201401334naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001842450072001921000022002647000023002861100015003097100031003245200561003556500076009166530014009926550020010067730030010268560006010569030018010621434063  a201405       201402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0252-y  aJ1311aA Reversal in the Relationship of Human Development with Fertility?10aHarttgen, Kenneth10aVollmer, Sebastian  aETH Zurich  aU Goettingen and Harvard U  aMyrskyla et al.

Results controlling for endogeneity suggest that both coresidence and working are associated with a delay in childbearing, reversing the effect of coresidence on the timing of first birth but not that of working. Women in earlier cohorts tend to choose coresidency and not working, and an increasing number of women from later cohorts choose to do both or to work only. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22)  aTaiwan  aBirth  a Childbearing  a Labor Supply  a Women  aJournal Article  g51g1h185-204tDemography  iN  aFebruary 201402672naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002162450072002241000021002967000018003171100044003357100017003795201112003966500084015086500076015926500109016686500119017776500172018966510011020686530010020796530014020896530013021036530012021166530013021286530012021416530011021536550020021647730030021848560006022149030018022201434065  a201405       201402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0239-8  aJ12  aJ13  aO15  aO18  aR2313aThe Impact of Family Transitions on Child Fostering in Rural Malawi10aGrant, Monica J.10aYeatman, Sara  aCenter for Demography and Ecology, U WI  aU CO, Denver  aDespite the frequency of divorce and remarriage across much of sub-Saharan Africa, little is known about what these events mean for the living arrangements of children. We use longitudinal data from rural Malawi to examine the effects of family transitions on the prevalence and incidence of child fostering, or children residing apart from their living parents. We find that between 7% and 15% of children aged 3-14 are out-fostered over the two-year intersurvey period. Although divorce appears to be a significant driver of child fostering in the cross-sectional analysis, it is not significantly associated with the incidence of out-fostering. In contrast, maternal remarriage has both a lagged and an immediate effect on the incidence of out-fostering. Furthermore, the likelihood of out-fostering is even higher among children whose mother remarried and had a new child during the intersurvey period. Using longitudinal data collected from living mothers rather than from children's current foster homes offers new insights into the reasons children are sent to live with others besides their parents. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aMalawi  aChild  a Children  a Divorce  a Family  a Mothers  a Parent  a Rural  aJournal Article  g51g1h205-28tDemography  iN  aFebruary 201402349naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002082450065002161000020002811100026003015201225003276500038015526500052015906500076016426500109017186510023018276530010018506530014018606530012018746530015018866530012019016550020019137730030019338560006019639030018019691434066  a201405       201402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0237-x  aI12  aI15  aJ13  aO1510aGrowing Up Together: Cohort Composition and Child Investment10aJones, Kelly M.  aIFPRI, Washington, DC  aIn sub-Saharan Africa, 60% of child deaths are preventable by investments in child health as simple as immunizations, bed nets, or water purification. This article investigates how a household's decisions regarding such investments are affected by the size and gender composition of a child's cohort. I focus on a previously overlooked type of investment: nonrival, child-specific goods (club goods). I empirically estimate the response of immunization status to cohort characteristics. I carefully address the problem of endogenous fertility, which is common in cohort studies. Because most rural Senegalese households are composed of multiple nuclear families, a child's cohort is composed of both siblings and nonsibling children. Estimating within households, I instrument cohort characteristics with those of the nonsibling (exogenous) portion. I find that children with larger (or more predominantly male) cohorts of vaccine-eligible age are significantly more likely to receive immunization. These findings suggest that children with larger cohorts may be better off in terms of club investments; this is a significant finding for child health given that many illness prevention methods are of a club good nature. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth and Economic Development         b(I15) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSub-Saharan Africa  aChild  a Children  a Deaths  a Fertility  a Health  aJournal Article  g51g1h229-55tDemography  iN  aFebruary 201402429naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001922450095002001000018002957000020003137000021003331100053003547100053004077100053004605201303005136500084018166500066019006510009019666530011019756530012019866530019019986550020020177730030020378560006020679030018020731434067  a201405       201402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0247-8  aJ12  aJ1610aGender, Turning Points, and Boomerangs: Returning Home in Young Adulthood in Great Britain10aStone, Juliet10aBerrington, Ann10aFalkingham, Jane  aESRC Centre for Population Change, U Southampton  aESRC Centre for Population Change, U Southampton  aESRC Centre for Population Change, U Southampton  aThe idea of a generation of young adults "boomeranging" back to the parental home has gained widespread currency in the British popular press. However, there is little empirical research identifying either increasing rates of returning home or the factors associated with this trend. This article addresses this gap in the literature using data from a long-running household panel survey to examine the occurrence and determinants of returning to the parental home. We take advantage of the longitudinal design of the British Household Panel Survey (1991-2008) and situate returning home in the context of other life-course transitions. We demonstrate how turning points in an individual's life course--such as leaving full-time education, unemployment, or partnership dissolution--are key determinants of returning home. An increasingly unpredictable labor market means that employment cannot be taken for granted following university graduation, and returning home upon completion of higher education is becoming normative. We also find that gender moderates the relationship among partnership dissolution, parenthood, and returning to the parental home, reflecting the differential welfare support in Great Britain for single parents compared with nonresident fathers and childless young adults. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.K.  aGender  a Parent  a Single Parent  aJournal Article  g51g1h257-76tDemography  iN  aFebruary 201401726naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001922450105002001000023003057000027003287000024003557000020003797000021003991100037004207100037004577100037004947100031005317100009005625200481005716500076010526500109011286510011012376530015012486530015012636550020012787730030012988560006013289030018013341434068  a201405       201402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0269-2  aJ13  aO1510aChallenges in Measuring the Sequencing of Life Events among Adolescents in Malawi: A Cautionary Note10aMensch, Barbara S.20aSoler-Hampejsek, Erica10aKelly, Christine A.10aHewett, Paul C.10aGrant, Monica J.  aPopulation Council, New York, NY  aPopulation Council, New York, NY  aPopulation Council, New York, NY  aPopulation Council, Lusaka  aU WI  aUsing data from two rounds of the Malawi Schooling and Adolescent Survey, this research note examines consistency of retrospective reporting on the timing and sequencing of sexual initiation, school leaving, and marriage.

The beneficial effect of changes in age structure after a decrease in fertility has become known as the "demographic dividend." In this article, we reassess the empirical evidence on the associations among economic growth, changes in age structure, labor force participation, and educational attainment. Using a global panel of countries, we find that after the effect of human capital dynamics is controlled for, no evidence exists that changes in age structure affect labor productivity. Our results imply that improvements in educational attainment are the key to explaining productivity and income growth and that a substantial portion of the demographic dividend is an education dividend. 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24)  aDemographics  a Demography  a Education  a Human Capital  a Labor Productivity  a Population  a Productivity  aJournal Article  g51g1h299-315tDemography  iN  aFebruary 201402207naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002002450098002081000022003061100023003285201203003516500084015546500066016386500058017046510016017626530008017786530014017866530019018006550020018197730030018398560006018699030018018751434071  a201405       201402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0248-7  aJ12  aJ16  aK3913aThe Effect of Same-Sex Marriage Laws on Different-Sex Marriage: Evidence from the Netherlands10aTrandafir, Mircea  aU Southern Denmark  aIt has long been argued that the legalization of same-sex marriage would have a negative impact on marriage. In this article, I examine how different-sex marriage in the Netherlands was affected by the enactment of two laws: a 1998 law that provided all couples with an institution almost identical to marriage (a "registered partnership") and a 2001 law that legalized same-sex marriage for the first time in the world. I first construct a synthetic control for the Netherlands using OECD data for the period 1988-2005 and find that neither law had significant effects on either the overall or different-sex marriage rate. I next construct a unique individual-level data set covering the period 1995-2005 by combining the Dutch Labor Force Survey and official municipal records. The estimates from a discrete-time hazard model with unobserved heterogeneity for the first-marriage decision confirm the findings in the aggregate analysis. The effects of the two laws are heterogeneous, with presumably more-liberal individuals (as defined by their residence or ethnicity) marrying less after passage of both laws and potentially more-conservative individuals marrying more after passage of each law. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aOther Substantive Areas of Law: Other         b(K39)  aNetherlands  aLaw  a Marriage  a Marriage Rate  aJournal Article  g51g1h317-40tDemography  iN  aFebruary 201400562naa  2200205   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001842450018001921000020002101100009002306500042002396550020002817730031003018560006003329030018003381421001  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0266-5  aY2010aEditor's Note10aTolnay, Stewart  aU WA 4aIntroductory Material         b(Y20)  aJournal Article  g50g6h1943-44tDemography  iN  aDecember 201301658naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001842450114001921000016003061100031003225200931003536500054012846530015013386550020013537730031013738560006014049030018014101421002  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0243-z  aC5111aAssessing Validity and Application Scope of the Intrinsic Estimator Approach to the Age-Period-Cohort Problem10aLuo, Liying  aMN Population Center, U MN  aIn many different fields, social scientists desire to understand temporal variation associated with age, time period, and cohort membership. Among methods proposed to address the identification problem in age-period-cohort analysis, the intrinsic estimator (IE) is reputed to impose few assumptions and to yield good estimates of the independent effects of age, period, and cohort groups. This article assesses the validity and application scope of IE theoretically and illustrates its properties with simulations. It shows that IE implicitly assumes a constraint on the linear age, period, and cohort effects. This constraint not only depends on the number of age, period, and cohort categories but also has nontrivial implications for estimation. Because this assumption is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to verify in empirical research, IE cannot and should not be used to estimate age, period, and cohort effects. 4aModel Construction and Estimation         b(C51)  aEstimation  aJournal Article  g50g6h1945-67tDemography  iN  aDecember 201300780naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001842450135001921000022003277000021003491100009003707100042003796500054004216550020004757730031004958560006005269030018005321421003  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0254-9  aC5110aMisunderstandings, Mischaracterizations, and the Problematic Choice of a Specific Instance in Which the IE Should Never Be Applied10aYang, Yang Claire10aLand, Kenneth C.  aU NC  aPopulation Research Institute, Duke U 4aModel Construction and Estimation         b(C51)  aJournal Article  g50g6h1969-71tDemography  iN  aDecember 201300682naa  2200205   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001842450123001921000023003151100009003386500054003476550020004017730031004218560006004529030018004581421004  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0250-0  aC5111aAssessing Validity and Application Scope of the Intrinsic Estimator Approach to the Age-Period-Cohort Problem: Comment10aO'Brien, Robert M.  aU OR 4aModel Construction and Estimation         b(C51)  aJournal Article  g50g6h1973-75tDemography  iN  aDecember 201300771naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001842450129001921000019003217000020003401100013003607100039003736500054004126550020004667730031004868560006005179030018005231421005  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0255-8  aC5111aAssessing Validity and Application Scope of the Intrinsic Estimator Approach to the Age-Period-Cohort (APC) Problem: Comment10aHeld, Leonhard10aRiebler, Andrea  aU Zurich  aNorwegian U Science and Technology 4aModel Construction and Estimation         b(C51)  aJournal Article  g50g6h1977-79tDemography  iN  aDecember 201300616naa  2200205   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001842450046001921000025002381100022002636500050002856550020003357730031003558560006003869030018003921421006  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0251-z  aY7010aCohort Analysis' Unholy Quest: Discussion10aFienberg, Stephen E.  aCarnegie Mellon U 4aNo Author General Discussions         b(Y70)  aJournal Article  g50g6h1981-84tDemography  iN  aDecember 201300633naa  2200205   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001842450059001921000016002511100031002676500054002986550020003527730031003728560006004039030018004091421007  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0263-8  aC5110aParadigm Shift in Age-Period-Cohort Analysis: Response10aLuo, Liying  aMN Population Center, U MN 4aModel Construction and Estimation         b(C51)  aJournal Article  g50g6h1985-88tDemography  iN  aDecember 201301910naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002242450110002321000020003427000022003621100012003847100009003965200510004056500092009156500038010076500042010456500045010876500108011326500113012406510009013536530015013626530012013776530010013896530012013996550020014117730033014318560006014649030018014701421008  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0227-z  aH75  aI12  aI21  aI24  aJ14  aJ1513aThe Effect of School Quality on Black-White Health Differences: Evidence from Segregated Southern Schools10aFrisvold, David10aGolberstein, Ezra  aEmory U  aU MN  aThis study assesses the effect of black-white differences in school quality on black-white differences in health in later life resulting from the racial convergence in school quality for cohorts born between 1910 and 1950 in southern states with segregated schools.

Recent birth cohorts living in England and born in Ireland, however, are healthier than the English population. The substantial Irish migrant health penalty arises principally for cohorts born between 1920 and 1960. In this article, we attempt to understand the processes that generated these changing migrant health patterns for Irish migrants to England. Our results suggest a strong role for economic selection in driving the dynamics of health differences between Irish-born migrants and white English populations. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth and Inequality         b(I14) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Europe: 1913-         b(N34)  aIreland; U.K.  aHealth  aJournal Article  g50g6h2013-35tDemography  iN  aDecember 201301916naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001842450121001921000012003137000016003257000021003411100040003627100019004027100040004215200998004616500038014596510016014976530011015136530015015246550020015397730031015598560006015909030018015961421010  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0232-2  aI1210aExtending the Lee-Carter Method to Model the Rotation of Age Patterns of Mortality Decline for Long-Term Projections10aLi, Nan10aLee, Ronald10aGerland, Patrick  aPopulation Division, United Nations  aU CA, Berkeley  aPopulation Division, United Nations  aIn developed countries, mortality decline is decelerating at younger ages and accelerating at old ages, a phenomenon we call "rotation." We expect that this rotation will also occur in developing countries as they attain high life expectancies. But the rotation is subtle and has proved difficult to handle in mortality models that include all age groups. Without taking it into account, however, long-term mortality projections will produce questionable results. We simplify the problem by focusing on the relative magnitude of death rates at two ages (0 and 15-19) while making assumptions about changes in rates of decline at other ages. We extend the Lee-Carter method to incorporate this subtle rotation in projection. We suggest that the extended Lee-Carter method could provide plausible projections of the age pattern of mortality for populations, including those that currently have very high life expectancies. Detailed examples are given using data from Japan and the United States. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aJapan; U.S.  aDeaths  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g50g6h2037-51tDemography  iN  aDecember 201303103naa  2200529   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002082450115002161000020003317000021003517000019003727000018003911100012004097100047004217100035004687100012005035201497005156500038020126500073020506500077021236500098022006510016022986530011023146530012023256530014023376530013023516530013023646530012023776530017023896530013024066530015024196530015024346530021024496530012024706530016024826550020024987730031025188560006025499030018025551421011  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0234-0  aI12  aI18  aJ11  aZ1310aMigration and Pacific Mortality: Estimating Migration Effects on Pacific Mortality Rates Using Bayesian Models10aRichardson, Ken10aJatrana, Santosh10aTobias, Martin10aBlakely, Tony  aU Otago  aAlfred Deakin Research Institute, Deakin U  aNew Zealand Ministry of Health  aU Otago  aPacific people living in New Zealand have higher mortality rates than New Zealand residents of European/Other ethnicity. The aim of this paper is to see whether Pacific mortality rates vary by natality and duration of residence. We used linked census-mortality information for 25- to 74-year-olds in the 2001 census followed for up to three years. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling provided a means of handling sparse data. Posterior mortality rates were directly age-standardized. We found little evidence of mortality differences between the overseas-born and the New Zealand-born for all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. However, we found evidence for lower all-cause (and possibly cancer and CVD) mortality rates for Pacific migrants resident in New Zealand for less than 25 years relative to those resident for more than 25 years. This result may arise from a combination of processes operating over time, including health selection effects from variations in New Zealand's immigration policy, the location of Pacific migrants within the social, political, and cultural environment of the host community, and health impacts of the host culture. We could not determine the relative importance of these processes, but identifying the (modifiable) drivers of the inferred long-term decline in health of the overseas-born Pacific population relative to more-recent Pacific migrants is important to Pacific communities and from a national health and policy perspective. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aNew Zealand  aCancer  a Census  a Cultural  a Culture  a Disease  a Health  a Immigration  a Migrant  a Migration  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  a Policy  a Population  aJournal Article  g50g6h2053-73tDemography  iN  aDecember 201303094naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002082450087002161000019003037000020003227000030003421100008003727100008003807100021003885201761004096500084021706500076022546500066023306500163023966510009025596530010025686530014025786530016025926530011026086550020026197730033026398560006026729030018026781421012  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0241-1  aJ12  aJ13  aJ16  aN3210aCohort Trends in Premarital First Births: What Role for the Retreat from Marriage?10aEngland, Paula10aWu, Lawrence L.10aShafer, Emily Fitzgibbons  aNYU  aNYU  aPortland State U  aWe examine cohort trends in premarital first births for U.S. women born between 1920 and 1964. The rise in premarital first births is often argued to be a consequence of the retreat from marriage, with later ages at first marriage resulting in more years of exposure to the risk of a premarital first birth. However, cohort trends in premarital first births may also reflect trends in premarital sexual activity, premarital conceptions, and how premarital conceptions are resolved. We decompose observed cohort trends in premarital first births into components reflecting cohort trends in (1) the age-specific risk of a premarital conception taken to term; (2) the age-specific risk of first marriages not preceded by such a conception, which will influence women's years of exposure to the risk of a premarital conception; and (3) whether a premarital conception is resolved by entering a first marriage before the resulting first birth (a "shotgun marriage"). For women born between 1920-1924 and 1945-1949, increases in premarital first births were primarily attributable to increases in premarital conceptions. For women born between 1945-1949 and 1960-1964, increases in premarital first births were primarily attributable to declines in responding to premarital conceptions by marrying before the birth. Trends in premarital first births were affected only modestly by the retreat from marriages not preceded by conceptions--a finding that holds for both whites and blacks. These results cast doubt on hypotheses concerning "marriageable" men and instead suggest that increases in premarital first births resulted initially from increases in premarital sex and then later from decreases in responding to a conception by marrying before a first birth. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Marriage  a Premarital  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g6h2075-2104tDemography  iN  aDecember 201301867naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002002450095002081000020003037000017003231100017003407100017003575200791003746500092011656500076012576500066013336510009013996530010014086530021014186530015014396550020014547730031014748560006015059030018015111421013  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0225-1  aH75  aJ13  aJ1610aDoes Parental Consent for Birth Control Affect Underage Pregnancy Rates?

We use state- and county-level data to test this prediction. The latter allow us to compare the impact of parental consent in counties with and without state-funded family planning clinics. We control for characteristics systematically correlated with the presence of state-funded clinics by combining difference-in-difference estimation with propensity score-weighted regressions. The evidence suggests that the parental consent mandate led to a large decrease in attendance at family planning clinics among teens but did not lead to an increase in underage pregnancies. 4aState and Local Government: Health; Education; Welfare; Public Pensions         b(H75) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Family Planning  a Pregnancy  aJournal Article  g50g6h2105-28tDemography  iN  aDecember 201302764naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002002450054002081000022002627000022002847000028003067000022003341100037003567100009003937100009004027100009004115201613004206500045020336500076020786500066021546510009022206530015022296530018022446530016022626530013022786550020022917730031023118560006023429030018023481421014  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0238-9  aI24  aJ13  aJ1613aThe Educational Consequences of Teen Childbearing10aKane, Jennifer B.10aMorgan, S.

To what extent is this association causal? The estimated effects of teen motherhood on schooling vary widely, ranging from no discernible difference to 2.6 fewer years among teen mothers. The magnitude of educational consequences is therefore uncertain, despite voluminous policy and prevention efforts that rest on the assumption of a negative and presumably causal effect. This study adjudicates between two potential sources of inconsistency in the literature--methodological differences or cohort differences--by using a single, high-quality data source: namely, The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. We replicate analyses across four different statistical strategies: ordinary least squares regression; propensity score matching; and parametric and semiparametric maximum likelihood estimation. Results demonstrate educational consequences of teen childbearing, with estimated effects between 0.7 and 1.9 fewer years of schooling among teen mothers. We select our preferred estimate (0.7), derived from semiparametric maximum likelihood estimation, on the basis of weighing the strengths and limitations of each approach. Based on the range of estimated effects observed in our study, we speculate that variable statistical methods are the likely source of inconsistency in the past. We conclude by discussing implications for future research and policy, and recommend that future studies employ a similar multimethod approach to evaluate findings. 4aEducation and Inequality         b(I24) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aAdolescent  a Childbearing  a Motherhood  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g50g6h2129-50tDemography  iN  aDecember 201302637naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002082450080002161000030002967000024003267000028003501100011003787100011003897100011004005201329004116500076017406500113018166500066019296500078019956510009020736530010020826530015020926530011021076530019021186530015021376550020021527730031021728560006022039030018022091421015  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0231-3  aJ13  aJ15  aJ16  aJ6410aCommunity-Wide Job Loss and Teenage Fertility: Evidence from North Carolina10aAnanat, Elizabeth Oltmans20aGassman-Pines, Anna20aGibson-Davis, Christina  aDuke U  aDuke U  aDuke U  aUsing North Carolina data for the period 1990-2010, we estimate the effects of economic downturns on the birthrates of 15- to 19-year-olds, using county-level business closings and layoffs as a plausibly exogenous source of variation in the strength of the local economy. We find little effect of job losses on the white teen birthrate. For black teens, however, job losses to 1% of the working-age population decrease the birthrate by around 2%. Birth declines start five months after the job loss and then last for more than one year. Linking the timing of job losses and conceptions suggests that black teen births decline because of increased terminations and perhaps also because of changes in prepregnancy behaviors. National data on risk behaviors also provide evidence that black teens reduce sexual activity and increase contraception use in response to job losses. Job losses seven to nine months after conception do not affect teen birthrates, indicating that teens do not anticipate job losses and lending confidence that job losses are "shocks" that can be viewed as quasi-experimental variation. We also find evidence that relatively advantaged black teens disproportionately abort after job losses, implying that the average child born to a black teen in the wake of job loss is relatively more disadvantaged. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aUnemployment: Models, Duration, Incidence, and Job Search         b(J64)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Birthrate  a Child  a Contraception  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g50g6h2151-71tDemography  iN  aDecember 201303164naa  2200553   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002240430008002322450170002401000017004101100020004275201344004476500077017916500067018686500064019356500087019996500054020866500099021406500063022396510011023026530018023136530018023316530016023496530015023656530012023806530010023926530020024026530017024226530014024396530015024536530016024686530015024846530012024996530013025116530011025246550020025357730031025558560006025869030018025921421016  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0236-y  aJ11  aQ23  aQ25  aQ31  aQ41  aQ53  aQ5410aHas the World Really Survived the Population Bomb? How the World Survived the Population Bomb: Lessons from 50 Years of Extraordinary Demographic History: Commentary10aBecker, Stan  aJohns Hopkins U  aIn his PAA presidential address and corresponding article in Demography, David Lam (2011) documented the extraordinary progress of humankind--vis-a-vis poverty alleviation, increased schooling, and reductions in mortality and fertility--since 1960 and noted that he expects further improvements by 2050. However, although Lam briefly covered the problems of global warming and pollution, he did not address several other major environmental problems that are closely related to the rapid human population growth in recent decades and to the progress he described. This commentary highlights some of these problems to provide a more balanced perspective on the situation of the world. Specifically, humans currently are using resources at an unsustainable level. Groundwater depletion and overuse of river water are major problems on multiple continents. Fossil fuel resources and several minerals are being depleted. Other major problems include deforestation, with the annual forest clearing globally estimated to be an area the size of New York State; and species extinction, with rates estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times higher than background rates. Principles of ecological economics are presented that allow an integration of ecology and economic development and better potential for preservation of the world for future generations. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aRenewable Resources and Conservation: Forestry         b(Q23) 4aRenewable Resources and Conservation: Water         b(Q25) 4aNonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Demand and Supply; Prices         b(Q31) 4aEnergy: Demand and Supply; Prices         b(Q41) 4aAir Pollution; Water Pollution; Noise; Hazardous Waste; Solid Waste; Recycling         b(Q53) 4aClimate; Natural Disasters; Global Warming         b(Q54)  aGlobal  aDeforestation  a Demographics  a Demography  a Depletion  a Forest  a Fuel  a Global Warming  a Groundwater  a Minerals  a Pollution  a Population  a Resources  a Rivers  a Warming  a Water  aJournal Article  g50g6h2173-81tDemography  iN  aDecember 201301445naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002240430008002322450165002401000015004051100009004206500077004296500067005066500064005736500087006376500054007246500099007786500063008776510011009406530017009516530016009686550020009847730031010048560006010359030018010411421017  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0249-6  aJ11  aQ23  aQ25  aQ31  aQ41  aQ53  aQ5410aHas the World Really Survived the Population Bomb?

We provide new evidence on this question by comparing observed ability differences and observed investment differences between siblings living in the United States. To overcome endogeneity issues, we use sibling differences in handedness as an instrument for cognitive ability differences. We find that parents invest more in high-ability children, with a 1 standard deviation increase in child cognitive ability increasing parental investments by approximately one-third of a standard deviation. Consequently, differences in child cognitive ability are enhanced by differential parental investments. 4aHousehold Production and Intrahousehold Allocation         b(D13) 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  aJournal Article  g50g6h2187-2208tDemography  iN  aDecember 201302115naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001922450069002001000021002697000017002907000019003071100027003267100027003537100027003805201098004076500045015056500109015506510023016596530017016826530015016996550020017147730031017348560006017659030018017711421019  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0228-y  aI24  aO1513aThe Impact of Educational Homogamy on Isolated Illiteracy Levels10aPermanyer, Inaki10aGarcia, Joan10aEsteve, Albert  aAutonomous U Barcelona  aAutonomous U Barcelona  aAutonomous U Barcelona  aIn this article, we explore the impacts that education expansion and increased levels in educational homogamy have had on couples' isolated illiteracy rates, defined as the proportion of illiterates in union that are married to an illiterate partner. First, we develop the methodology to decompose isolated illiteracy rates into two main components: one related to level of homogamy among illiterates, and the other related to the educational distribution of the spouses. Second, we use harmonized international census microdata from IPUMS and DHS data for 73 countries and 217 samples to investigate which of the two components is more important in shaping the level of isolated illiteracy. Our results indicate that the expansion of literacy has been more powerful than the increases in the tendency toward homogamy in its impact on isolated illiteracy rates. As the percentage of illiterates decreases over time, an increasingly large proportion of them marry literate individuals, showing that opportunities for intermarriage among illiterates expand despite the strengthening of homogamy. 4aEducation and Inequality         b(I24) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSelected Countries  aDistribution  a Education  aJournal Article  g50g6h2209-25tDemography  iN  aDecember 201302257naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002082450033002161000021002497000017002707000018002877000023003051100009003287100012003377100012003497100033003615200947003946500038013416500076013796500172014556500077016276510009017046530010017136530011017236530012017346530014017466550020017607730031017808560006018119030018018171421020  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0230-4  aI12  aJ13  aR23  aR3810aLife Shocks and Homelessness10aCurtis, Marah A.10aCorman, Hope10aNoonan, Kelly10aReichman, Nancy E.  aU WI  aRider U  aRider U  aChild Health Institute of NJ  aWe exploited an exogenous health shock--namely, the birth of a child with a severe health condition--to investigate the effect of a life shock on homelessness in large cities in the United States as well as the interactive effects of the shock with housing market characteristics. We considered a traditional measure of homelessness, two measures of housing instability thought to be precursors to homelessness, and a combined measure that approximates the broadened conceptualization of homelessness under the 2009 Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act (2010). We found that the shock substantially increases the likelihood of family homelessness, particularly in cities with high housing costs. The findings are consistent with the economic theory of homelessness, which posits that homelessness results from a conjunction of adverse circumstances in which housing markets and individual characteristics collide. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aProduction Analysis and Firm Location: Government Policy         b(R38)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Child  a Health  a Homeless  aJournal Article  g50g6h2227-53tDemography  iN  aDecember 201301915naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001922450062002001000015002627000023002771100016003007100016003165201032003326500076013646500089014406510011015296530010015406550020015507730031015708560006016019030018016071421021  a201403       201312                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0233-1  aJ13  aJ3213aThe Impact of Paternity Leave on Fathers' Future Earnings10aRege, Mari10aSolli, Ingeborg F.  aU Stavanger  aU Stavanger  aUsing Norwegian registry data, we investigate the effect of paternity leave on fathers' long-term earnings. If the paternity leave increased long-term father involvement, then we should expect a reduction in fathers' long-term earnings as they shift time and effort from market to home production. For identification, we use the Norwegian introduction of a paternity-leave quota in 1993, reserving four weeks of the total of 42 weeks of paid parental leave exclusively for the father. The introduction of the paternity-leave quota led to a sharp increase in rates of leave-taking for fathers. We estimate a difference-in-differences model that exploits differences in fathers' exposure to the paternity-leave quota by the child's age and year of observation. Our analysis suggests that four weeks of paternity leave during the child's first year decreases fathers' future earnings, an effect that persists through our last point of observation, when the child is 5 years old. A battery of robustness tests supports our results. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aNonwage Labor Costs and Benefits; Retirement Plans; Private Pensions         b(J32)  aNorway  aChild  aJournal Article  g50g6h2255-77tDemography  iN  aDecember 201302885naa  2200469   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002242450091002321000019003237000019003421100013003617100091003745201340004656500038018056500042018436500073018856500076019586500066020346500109021006510023022096530010022326530011022426530014022536530015022676530016022826530013022986530019023116530011023306550020023417730031023618560006023929030017023981401762  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0220-6  aI12  aI14  aI18  aJ13  aJ16  aO1510aSingle Motherhood and Child Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Life Course Perspective10aClark, Shelley10aHamplova, Dana  aMcGill U  aCharles U Prague and Institute of Sociology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic  aSingle motherhood in sub-Saharan Africa has received surprisingly little attention, although it is widespread and has critical implications for children's well-being. Using survival analysis techniques, we estimate the probability of becoming a single mother over women's life course and investigate the relationship between single motherhood and child mortality in 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Although a mere 5% of women in Ethiopia have a premarital birth, one in three women in Liberia will become mothers before first marriage. Compared with children whose parents were married, children born to never-married single mothers were significantly more likely to die before age 5 in six countries (odds ratios range from 1.36 in Nigeria to 2.61 in Zimbabwe). In addition, up to 50% of women will become single mothers as a consequence of divorce or widowhood. In nine countries, having a formerly married mother was associated with a significantly higher risk of dying (odds ratios range from 1.29 in Zambia to 1.75 in Kenya) relative to having married parents. Children of divorced women typically had the poorest outcomes. These results highlight the vulnerability of children with single mothers and suggest that policies aimed at supporting single mothers could help to further reduce child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth and Inequality         b(I14) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSub-Saharan Africa  aBirth  a Child  a Children  a Mortality  a Motherhood  a Mothers  a Single Mother  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g5h1521-49tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302299naa  2200469   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002242450100002321000027003321100015003595200862003746500038012366500042012746500042013166500076013586500066014346500109015006510012016096530010016216530018016316530015016496530012016646530014016766530015016906530013017056530015017186530011017336530011017446550020017557730031017758560006018069030017018121401763  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0209-1  aI12  aI14  aI21  aJ13  aJ16  aO1510aMaternal Reading Skills and Child Mortality in Nigeria: A Reassessment of Why Education Matters20aSmith-Greenaway, Emily  aPA State U  aMother's formal schooling--even at the primary level--is associated with lower risk of child mortality, although the reasons why remain unclear. This study examines whether mother's reading skills help to explain the association in Nigeria. Using data from the Demographic and Health Survey, the analysis demonstrates that women's reading skills increase linearly with years of primary school; however, many women with several years of formal school are unable to read at all. The results further show that mother's reading skills help to explain the relationship between mother's formal schooling and child mortality, and that mother's reading skills are highly associated with child mortality. The study highlights the need for more data on literacy and for more research on whether and how mother's reading skills lower child mortality in other contexts. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth and Inequality         b(I14) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aNigeria  aChild  a Demographics  a Education  a Health  a Literacy  a Mortality  a Mothers  a Schooling  a Skill  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g5h1551-61tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302151naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002002450111002081000013003197000022003327000023003541100066003777100009004437100009004525200992004616500038014536500108014916500066015996530010016656530012016756530015016876530013017026550020017157730031017358560006017669030017017721401764  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0222-4  aI12  aJ14  aJ1610aMortality Increase in Late-Middle and Early-Old Age: Heterogeneity in Death Processes as a New Explanation10aLi, Ting10aYang, Yang Claire10aAnderson, James J.  aCenter for Population and Development Studies, Renmin U China  aU NC  aU WA  aDeviations from the Gompertz law of exponential mortality increases in late-middle and early-old age are commonly neglected in overall mortality analyses. In this study, we examined mortality increase patterns between ages 40 and 85 in 16 low-mortality countries and demonstrated sex differences in these patterns, which also changed across period and cohort. These results suggest that the interaction between aging and death is more complicated than what is usually assumed from the Gompertz law and also challenge existing biodemographic hypotheses about the origin and mechanisms of sex differences in mortality. We propose a two-mortality model that explains these patterns as the change in the composition of intrinsic and extrinsic death rates with age. We show that the age pattern of overall mortality and the population heterogeneity therein are possibly generated by multiple dynamics specified by a two-mortality model instead of a uniform process throughout most adult ages. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aAging  a Deaths  a Mortality  a Old Age  aJournal Article  g50g5h1563-91tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302356naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002162450122002241000023003467000019003691100012003887100014004005200917004146500071013316500038014026500084014406500108015246500160016326510010017926530012018026530012018146530016018266530015018426530013018576550020018707730033018908560006019239030017019291401765  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0218-0  aD13  aI12  aJ12  aJ14  aN3310aLiving Arrangements and the Elderly: An Analysis of Old-Age Mortality by Household Structure in Casalguidi, 1819-185910aManfredini, Matteo10aBreschi, Marco  aU Parma  aU Sassari  aThe elevated levels of protection, assistance, and care enjoyed by the elderly living in complex households has long been a key assumption of many family system theories. However, although this hypothesis has been demonstrated for contemporary contexts, quantitative evidence for past populations is particularly scarce, if not nonexistent. This article investigates the relationship between old-age mortality and living arrangements in a mid-nineteenth century Tuscan population, where the joint family system of sharecroppers coexisted alongside the nuclear system of day laborers. Our findings demonstrate that within complex households, the complexity of relationships, gender inequalities, and possible competition for care and resources among the most vulnerable household members--namely, the elderly and the young--weakens the assumption that the elderly benefitted from lower rates of old-age mortality. 4aHousehold Production and Intrahousehold Allocation         b(D13) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Europe: Pre-1913         b(N33)  aItaly  aElderly  a Family  a Households  a Mortality  a Old Age  aJournal Article  g50g5h1593-1613tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302463naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002082450061002161000026002777000017003031100059003207100100003795201144004796500070016236500038016936500108017316500155018396510019019946530011020136530015020246550020020397730031020598560006020909030017020961401766  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0223-3  aC43  aI12  aJ14  aP3610aPerturbation Analysis of Indices of Lifespan Variability10avan Raalte, Alyson A.10aCaswell, Hal  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution  aA number of indices exist to calculate lifespan variation, each with different underlying properties. Here, we present new formulae for the response of seven of these indices to changes in the underlying mortality schedule (life disparity, Gini coefficient, standard deviation, variance, Theil's index, mean logarithmic deviation, and interquartile range). We derive each of these indices from an absorbing Markov chain formulation of the life table, and use matrix calculus to obtain the sensitivity and the elasticity (i.e., the proportional sensitivity) to changes in age-specific mortality. Using empirical French and Russian male data, we compare the underlying sensitivities to mortality change under different mortality regimes to determine the conditions under which the indices might differ in their conclusions about the magnitude of lifespan variation. Finally, we demonstrate how the sensitivities can be used to decompose temporal changes in the indices into contributions of age-specific mortality changes.

In this article, I use data from the Current Population Survey Fertility Supplements (1995, 1998, 2004, 2008) and logistic regression and regression-based decomposition techniques to assess the contribution of changes in educational attainment, marriage behavior, and racial/ethnic composition on population levels of childlessness in the United States. Results show that increases in the proportion of women unmarried by age 40 contributed most to the increase in childlessness in the late twentieth century, although these increases were offset somewhat by increased childbearing among unmarried women. The rising proportion of women with a college degree also explained a substantial amount of the increase in childless women. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aChildbearing  a Demographics  a Fertility  a Marriage  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g5h1641-61tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302348naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002002450079002081000023002877000022003101100009003327100009003415201158003506500084015086500076015926500109016686510009017776530017017866530019018036530012018226530015018346530013018496530014018626530012018766550020018887730031019088560006019399030017019451401768  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0221-5  aJ12  aJ13  aO1510aMarital Processes, Arranged Marriage, and Contraception to Limit Fertility10aGhimire, Dirgha J.10aAxinn, William G.  aU MI  aU MI  aAn international transition away from familially arranged marriages toward participation in spouse choice has endured for decades and continues to spread through rural Asia today. Although we know that this transformation has important consequences for childbearing early in marriage, we know much less about longer-term consequences of this marital revolution. Drawing on theories of family and fertility change and a rural Asian panel study designed to measure changes in both marital and childbearing behaviors, this study seeks to investigate these long-term consequences. Controlling for social changes that shape both marital practices and childbearing behaviors, and explicitly considering multiple dimensions of marital processes, we find evidence consistent with an independent, long-standing association of participation in spouse choice with higher rates of contraception to terminate childbearing. These results add a new dimension to the evidence linking revolutions in marital behavior to long-term declines in fertility and suggest that new research should consider a broader range of long-term consequences of changing marital processes. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aAsia  aChildbearing  a Contraception  a Family  a Fertility  a Marital  a Marriage  a Spouse  aJournal Article  g50g5h1663-86tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302322naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002162450094002241000015003187000018003331100016003517100014003675201001003816500084013826500076014666500066015426500102016086500047017106530010017576530018017676530012017856530015017976530013018126530011018256550020018367730033018568560006018899030017018951401769  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0216-2  aJ12  aJ13  aJ16  aR21  aR3110aInterrelationships between Childbearing and Housing Transitions in the Family Life Course10aKulu, Hill10aSteele, Fiona  aU Liverpool  aU Bristol  aResearch has examined the effect of family changes on housing transitions and childbearing patterns within various housing types. Although most research has investigated how an event in one domain of family life depends on the current state in another domain, the interplay between them has been little studied. This study examines the interrelationships between childbearing decisions and housing transitions. We use rich longitudinal register data from Finland and apply multilevel event history analysis to allow for multiple births and housing changes over the life course. We investigate the timing of fertility decisions and housing choices with respect to each other. We model childbearing and housing transitions jointly to control for time-invariant unobserved characteristics of women, which may simultaneously influence their fertility behavior and housing choices, and we show how joint modeling leads to a deeper understanding of the interplay between the two domains of family life. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand         b(R21) 4aHousing Supply and Markets         b(R31)  aBirth  a Childbearing  a Family  a Fertility  a Housing  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g5h1687-1714tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302502naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002082450092002161000018003087000022003267000022003481100059003707100009004297100009004385201212004476500084016596500076017436500066018196500109018856510011019946530011020056530015020166530011020316550020020427730031020628560006020939030017020991401770  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0214-4  aJ12  aJ13  aJ16  aO1510aYoung Women's Dynamic Family Size Preferences in the Context of Transitioning Fertility10aYeatman, Sara10aSennott, Christie10aCulpepper, Steven  aU CO, Denver and Institute of Behavioral Science, U CO  aU CO  aU IL  aDynamic theories of family size preferences posit that they are not a fixed and stable goal but rather are akin to a moving target that changes within individuals over time. Nonetheless, in high-fertility contexts, changes in family size preferences tend to be attributed to low construct validity and measurement error instead of genuine revisions in preferences. To address the appropriateness of this incongruity, the present study examines evidence for the sequential model of fertility among a sample of young Malawian women living in a context of transitioning fertility. Using eight waves of closely spaced data and fixed-effects models, we find that these women frequently change their reported family size preferences and that these changes are often associated with changes in their relationship and reproductive circumstances. The predictability of change gives credence to the argument that ideal family size is a meaningful construct, even in this higher-fertility setting. Changes are not equally predictable across all women, however, and gamma regression results demonstrate that women for whom reproduction is a more distant goal change their fertility preferences in less-predictable ways. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMalawi  aFamily  a Fertility  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g5h1715-37tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302489naa  2200469   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002082450072002161000019002887000020003077000023003277000020003501100039003707100037004097100019004467100019004655201038004846500042015226500076015646500066016406500109017066510015018156530010018306530011018406530014018516530018018656530015018836530021018986530015019196530011019346550020019457730031019658560006019969030017020021401771  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0202-8  aI14  aJ13  aJ16  aO1510aInfluences on Pregnancy-Termination Decisions in Matlab, Bangladesh10aDaVanzo, Julie10aRahman, Mizanur10aAhmed, Shahabuddin10aRazzaque, Abdur  aRAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aCarolina Population Center, U NC  aicddr,b, Dhaka  aicddr,b, Dhaka  aWe investigate factors affecting women's decisions to terminate pregnancies in Matlab, Bangladesh, using logistic regression on high-quality data from the Demographic Surveillance System on more than 215,000 pregnancies that occurred between 1978 and 2008. Variables associated with the desire not to have another birth soon (very young and older maternal age, a greater number of living children, the recent birth of twins or of a son, a short interval since a recent live birth) are associated with a greater likelihood of pregnancy termination, and the effects of many of these explanatory variables are stronger in more recent years. Women are less likely to terminate a pregnancy if they don't have any living sons or recently experienced a miscarriage, a stillbirth, or the death of a child. The higher the woman's level of education, the more likely she is to terminate a pregnancy. Between 1982 and the mid-2000s, pregnancy termination was significantly less likely in the area of Matlab with better family planning services. 4aHealth and Inequality         b(I14) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBangladesh  aBirth  a Child  a Children  a Demographics  a Education  a Family Planning  a Pregnancy  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g5h1739-64tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302248naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002162450098002241000024003221100040003465200873003866500056012596500084013156500076013996500066014756500172015416510009017136530015017226530015017376530014017526530012017666530010017786550020017887730031018088560006018399030017018451401772  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0219-z  aI32  aJ12  aJ13  aJ16  aR2310aDuration and Timing of Exposure to Neighborhood Poverty and the Risk of Adolescent Parenthood10aWodtke, Geoffrey T.  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aTheory suggests that the impact of neighborhood poverty depends on both the duration and timing of exposure. Previous research, however, has not properly analyzed the sequence of neighborhoods to which children are exposed throughout the early life course. This study investigates the effects of different longitudinal patterns of exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods on the risk of adolescent parenthood. It follows a cohort of children in the PSID from age 4 to 19 and uses novel methods for time-varying exposures that overcome critical limitations of conventional regression when selection processes are dynamic. Results indicate that sustained exposure to poor neighborhoods substantially increases the risk of becoming a teen parent and that exposure to neighborhood poverty during adolescence may be more consequential than exposure earlier during childhood. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aAdolescent  a Childhood  a Children  a Parent  a Poor  aJournal Article  g50g5h1765-88tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302116naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001922450124002001000016003247000018003401100014003587100014003725201112003866500084014986500066015826510009016486530017016576530014016746530014016886530012017026550020017147730033017348560006017679030017017731401773  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0203-7  aJ12  aJ1613aThe Compositional and Institutional Sources of Union Dissolution for Married and Unmarried Parents in the United States10aTach, Laura10aEdin, Kathryn  aCornell U  aHarvard U  aUnmarried parents have less stable unions than married parents, but there is considerable debate over the sources of this instability. Unmarried parents may be more likely than married parents to end their unions because of compositional differences, such as more disadvantaged personal and relationship characteristics, or because they lack the normative and institutional supports of marriage, thus rendering their relationships more sensitive to disadvantage. In this article, we evaluate these two sources of union instability among married, cohabiting, and dating parents following the birth of a shared child, using five waves of longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Using discrete-time event history models, we find that demographic, economic, and relationship differences explain more than two-thirds of the increased risk of dissolution for unmarried parents relative to married parents. We also find that differential responses to economic or relationship disadvantage do not explain why unmarried parents are more likely to end their unions than married parents. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Families  a Marriage  a Parent  aJournal Article  g50g5h1789-1818tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302987naa  2200457   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002240430008002322450097002401000024003377000017003611100030003787100037004085201339004456500055017846500090018396500084019296500066020136500064020796500109021436500125022526510015023776530009023926530018024016530012024196530013024316530011024446550020024557730031024758560006025069030017025121401774  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0226-0  aD14  aG21  aJ12  aJ16  aK42  aO15  aO1610aMicrocredit and Domestic Violence in Bangladesh: An Exploration of Selection Bias Influences10aBajracharya, Ashish10aAmin, Sajeda  aPopulation Council, Dhaka  aPopulation Council, New York, NY  aThis article explores the relationship between women's participation in microcredit groups and domestic violence in Bangladesh. Several recent studies have raised concern about microcredit programs by reporting higher levels of violence among women who are members. These results, however, may be attributable to selection bias because members might differ from nonmembers in ways that make them more susceptible to violence to begin with. Using a sample of currently married women from the 2007 Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey (BDHS) (N = 4,195), we use propensity score matching (PSM) as a way of exploring selection bias in this relationship. Results suggest that the previously seen strong positive association between membership and violence does not hold when an appropriate comparison group, generated using PSM, is used in the analyses. Additional analyses also suggest that levels of violence do not differ significantly between members and nonmembers and instead could depend on context-specific factors related to poverty. Members for whom a match is not found report considerably higher levels of violence relative to nonmembers in the unmatched group. The background characteristics of members and nonmembers who do not match suggest that they are more likely to be younger and from relatively well-to-do households. 4aHousehold Saving; Personal Finance         b(D14) 4aBanks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages         b(G21) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aIllegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law         b(K42) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Financial Markets; Saving and Capital Investment; Corporate Finance and Governance         b(O16)  aBangladesh  aBias  a Demographics  a Health  a Poverty  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g5h1819-43tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302459naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002162450084002241000027003087000018003357000022003531100011003757100013003867100032003995201034004316500055014656500069015206500084015896500066016736500109017396510015018486530013018636530012018766530012018886530013019006530014019136530012019276550020019397730031019598560006019909030017019961401775  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0208-2  aD14  aD31  aJ12  aJ16  aO1510aConsanguinity and Other Marriage Market Effects of a Wealth Shock in Bangladesh10aMobarak, Ahmed Mushfiq10aKuhn, Randall10aPeters, Christina  aYale U  aU Denver  aMetropolitan State U Denver  aThis paper uses a wealth shock from the construction of a flood protection embankment in rural Bangladesh coupled with data on the universe of all 52,000 marriage decisions between 1982 and 1996 to examine changes in marital prospects for households protected by the embankment relative to unprotected households living on the other side of the river. We use difference-in-difference specifications to document that brides from protected households commanded larger dowries, married wealthier households, and became less likely to marry biological relatives. Financial liquidity-constrained households appear to use within-family marriage (in which one can promise ex-post payments) as a form of credit to meet up-front dowry demands, but the resultant wealth shock for households protected by the embankment relaxed this need to marry consanguineously. Our results shed light on the socioeconomic roots of consanguinity, which carries health risks for offspring but can also carry substantial benefits for the families involved. 4aHousehold Saving; Personal Finance         b(D14) 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBangladesh  aFamilies  a Family  a Health  a Marital  a Marriage  a Wealth  aJournal Article  g50g5h1845-71tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302004naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002002450107002081000018003151100014003335200902003476500113012496500172013626500047015346530017015816530013015986530017016116550020016287730031016488560006016799030017016851401776  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0177-x  aJ15  aR23  aR3110aResidential Integration on the New Frontier: Immigrant Segregation in Established and New Destinations10aHall, Matthew  aCornell U  aThis article explores patterns and determinants of immigrant segregation for ten immigrant groups in established, new, and minor destination areas.

Neither controls for immigrant-group acculturation or socioeconomic status nor those for demographic, housing, and economic features of metropolitan areas can fully account for the heightened levels of segregation observed in new and minor destinations.

The Phases of IRCA Legislation and Relative Net Undercounts of the 1990 vis-a-vis 2000 Decennial Census for Foreign-Born Cohorts10aKaneshiro, Matheu  aRAND Corporation, Rosemead, CA  aThe quality of the decennial census of the United States is compromised by population undercount, which often misses immigrants and racial/ethnic minorities, thereby diminishing federal resources allocated to such groups. Using a modified version of demographic analysis and informed by the latest contributions of emigration scholarship, this research estimates net undercount for the 1990 census relative to the 2000 census by age, sex, year-of-entry, and place-of-birth cohorts. Ordinary least squares estimates suggest that males, recent arrivals, and cohorts aged 15-44 had higher relative net undercount for 1990 compared with 2000. Much higher relative net undercount was found for cohorts from Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean (excluding Cuba and Puerto Rico) who were ineligible for amnesty under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (i.e., those fitting the profile of an undocumented immigrant). Larger implications of these findings suggest that the political climate in which a person is embedded--particularly for persons who may feel threatened or marginalized by the government and/or the public--affects that person's willingness to respond to the census. 4aMethodology for Collecting, Estimating, and Organizing Microeconomic Data; Data Access         b(C81) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Census  a Cohorts  a Demographics  a Emigration  a Immigrant  a Immigration  a Minorities  a Population  a Racial  aJournal Article  g50g5h1897-1919tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302871naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002242450124002321000022003567000022003781100015004007100009004155201140004246500113015646500166016776500163018436500071020066500068020776500172021456510009023176530011023266530016023376530010023536530012023636550020023757730031023958560006024269030017024321401778  a201311       201310                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0210-8  aJ15  aN31  aN32  aN91  aN92  aR2311aA 'Mulatto Escape Hatch' in the United States? Examining Evidence of Racial and Social Mobility during the Jim Crow Era10aSaperstein, Aliya10aGullickson, Aaron  aStanford U  aU OR  aRacial distinctions in the United States have long been characterized as uniquely rigid and governed by strict rules of descent, particularly along the black-white boundary. This is often contrasted with countries, such as Brazil, that recognize "mixed" or intermediate racial categories and allow for more fluidity or ambiguity in racial classification. Recently released longitudinal data from the IPUMS Linked Representative Samples, and the brief inclusion of a "mulatto" category in the U.S. Census, allow us to subject this generally accepted wisdom to empirical test for the 1870-1920 period. We find substantial fluidity in black-mulatto classification between censuses--including notable "downward" racial mobility. Using person fixed-effects models, we also find evidence that among Southern men, the likelihood of being classified as mulatto was related to intercensal changes in occupational status. These findings have implications for studies of race and inequality in the United States, cross-national research on racial classification schemes in the Americas, and for how demographers collect and interpret racial data. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32) 4aRegional and Urban History: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N91) 4aRegional and Urban History: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N92) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Inequality  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g50g5h1921-42tDemography  iN  aOctober 201302384naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002242450037002321000015002697000022002841100015003067100052003215201041003736500055014146500069014696500081015386500059016196500066016786500083017446510009018276530011018366530019018476530012018666530011018786550020018897730031019098560006019409030016019461387700  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0182-0  aD14  aD31  aD91  aG11  aJ16  aJ2410aExplaining the Gender Wealth Gap10aRuel, Erin10aHauser, Robert M.  aGA State U  aCenter for Demography of Health and Aging, U WI  aTo assess and explain the United States' gender wealth gap, we use the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study to examine wealth accumulated by a single cohort over 50 years by gender, by marital status, and limited to the respondents who are their family's best financial reporters. We find large gender wealth gaps between currently married men and women, and between never-married men and women. The never-married accumulate less wealth than the currently married, and there is a marital disruption cost to wealth accumulation. The status-attainment model shows the most power in explaining gender wealth gaps between these groups explaining about one-third to one-half of the gap, followed by the human-capital explanation. In other words, a lifetime of lower earnings for women translates into greatly reduced wealth accumulation. After controlling for the full model, we find that a gender wealth gap remains between married men and women that we speculate may be related to gender differences in investment strategies and selection effects. 4aHousehold Saving; Personal Finance         b(D14) 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aIntertemporal Household Choice; Life Cycle Models and Saving         b(D91) 4aPortfolio Choice; Investment Decisions         b(G11) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24)  aU.S.  aGender  a Human Capital  a Wealth  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g4h1155-76tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302248naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002002450099002081000025003071100014003325201182003466500055015286500069015836500113016526510009017656530017017746530012017916530010018036530012018136530012018256550020018377730031018578560006018889030016018941387701  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0190-0  aD14  aD31  aJ1510aReturn to Being Black, Living in the Red: A Race Gap in Wealth That Goes beyond Social Origins10aKillewald, Alexandra  aHarvard U  aIn the United States, racial disparities in wealth are vast, yet their causes are only partially understood. In Being Black, Living in the Red, Conley (1999) argued that the sociodemographic traits of young blacks and their parents, particularly parental wealth, wholly explain their wealth disadvantage. Using data from the 1980-2009 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I show that this conclusion hinges on the specific sample considered and the treatment of debtors in the sample. I further document that prior research has paid insufficient attention to the possibility of variation in the association between wealth and race at different points of the net worth distribution. Among wealth holders, blacks remain significantly disadvantaged in assets compared with otherwise similar whites. Among debtors, however, young whites hold more debt than otherwise similar blacks. The results suggest that, among young adults, debt may reflect increased access to credit, not simply the absence of assets. The asset disadvantage for black net wealth holders also indicates that research and policy attention should not be focused only on young blacks "living in the red." 4aHousehold Saving; Personal Finance         b(D14) 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aDistribution  a Income  a Race  a Racial  a Wealth  aJournal Article  g50g4h1177-95tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302382naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002082450073002161000018002897000018003071100043003257100016003685201175003846500084015596500076016436500083017196500065018026510011018676530013018786530015018916530013019066530014019196550020019337730033019538560006019869030016019921387702  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0188-7  aJ12  aJ13  aJ24  aJ3110aEducational Homogamy and Gender-Specific Earnings: Sweden, 1990-200910aDribe, Martin10aNystedt, Paul  aCentre for Economic Demography, Lund U  aLinkoping U  aSeveral studies have shown strong educational homogamy in most Western societies, although the trends over time differ across countries. In this article, we study the connection between educational assortative mating and gender-specific earnings in a sample containing the entire Swedish population born 1960-1974; we follow this sample from 1990 to 2009. Our empirical strategy exploits a longitudinal design, using distributed fixed-effects models capturing the impact of partner education on postmarital earnings, relating it to the income development before union formation. We find that being partnered with someone with more education (hypergamy) is associated with higher earnings, while partnering someone with less education (hypogamy) is associated with lower earnings. However, most of these differences in earnings emerge prior to the time of marriage, implying that the effect is explained by marital selection processes rather than by partner education affecting earnings. The exception is hypogamy among the highly educated, for which there are strong indications that in comparison with homogamy and hypergamy, earnings grow slower after union formation. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31)  aSweden  aEarnings  a Education  a Marital  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g50g4h1197-1216tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302981naa  2200457   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002242450065002321000016002977000024003131100009003377100009003465201377003556500044017326500077017766500065018536500109019186500119020276500172021466510012023186530016023306530029023466530015023756530014023906530019024046530016024236530011024396550020024507730031024708560006025019030016025071387703  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0192-y  aF22  aJ11  aJ61  aO15  aO18  aR2310aEnvironmental Influences on Human Migration in Rural Ecuador10aGray, Clark10aBilsborrow, Richard  aU NC  aU NC  aThe question of whether environmental conditions influence human migration has recently gained considerable attention, driven by claims that global environmental change will displace large populations. Despite this high level of interest, few quantitative studies have investigated the potential effects of environmental factors on migration, particularly in the developing world and for gradual but pervasive forms of environmental change. To address this, a retrospective migration survey was conducted in rural Ecuador and linked to data on topography, climate, and weather shocks. These data were used to estimate multivariate event history models of alternative forms of mobility (local mobility, internal migration, and international migration), controlling for a large number of covariates. This approach is generalizable to other study areas and responds to calls for the development of more rigorous methods in this field. The results indicate that adverse environmental conditions do not consistently increase rural out-migration and, in some cases, reduce migration. Instead, households respond to environmental factors in diverse ways, resulting in complex migratory responses. Overall, the results support an alternative narrative of environmentally induced migration that recognizes the adaptability of rural households in responding to environmental change. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aEcuador  aDevelopment  a International Migration  a Migration  a Mobility  a Out Migration  a Population  a Rural  aJournal Article  g50g4h1217-41tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302986naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002240430008002322450068002401000017003081100019003255201309003446500044016536500077016976500084017746500109018586500119019676500172020866500098022586510034023566530011023906530029024016530013024306530015024436530021024586550020024797730031024998560006025309030016025361387704  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0213-5  aF22  aJ11  aJ12  aO15  aO18  aR23  aZ1310aMigrant Networks and International Migration: Testing Weak Ties10aLiu, Mao-Mei  aU Pompeu Fabra  aThis article examines the role of migrant social networks in international migration and extends prior research by testing the strength of tie theory, decomposing networks by sources and resources, and disentangling network effects from complementary explanations. Nearly all previous empirical research has ignored friendship ties and has largely neglected extended-family ties. Using longitudinal data from the Migration between Africa and Europe project collected in Africa (Senegal) and Europe (France, Italy, and Spain), this article tests the robustness of network theory--and in particular, the role of weak ties--on first-time migration between Senegal and Europe. Discrete-time hazard model results confirm that weak ties are important and that network influences appear to be gendered, but they do not uphold the contention in previous literature that strong ties are more important than weak ties for male and female migration. Indeed, weak ties play an especially important role in male migration. In terms of network resources, having more resources as a result of strong ties appears to dampen overall migration, while having more resources as a result of weaker ties appears to stimulate male migration. Finally, the diversity of resources has varied effects for male and female migration. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aFrance; Italy; Senegal; Spain  aFamily  a International Migration  a Migrant  a Migration  a Social Networks  aJournal Article  g50g4h1243-77tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302628naa  2200457   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002162450102002241000024003267000021003501100009003717100020003805201141004006500059015416500032016006500048016326500155016806500098018356510012019336530016019456530012019616530025019736530016019986530017020146530012020316530020020436530016020636530016020796550020020957730033021158560006021489030016021541387705  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0195-3  aD12  aF24  aI31  aP36  aZ1310aRemittances in the Republic of Georgia: Correlates, Economic Impact, and Social Capital Formation10aGerber, Theodore P.10aTorosyan, Karine  aU WI  aTbilisi State U  aThe economic impact of remittances on migrant-sending countries has been a subject of debate in the scholarly literature on migration. We consider the topic using a household-level approach. We use a new survey, "Georgia on the Move," to examine migrant-level, household-level, and contextual variables associated with the probability that a household in the Republic of Georgia receives remittances. We then apply propensity score matching to estimate how remittances affect particular types of household expenditures, savings, labor supply, health, and other measures of well-being. Separate analysis of the subsample of households with a migrant currently abroad distinguishes the effects of remittances from the effects of migration as such. In Georgia, remittances improve household economic well-being without, for the most part, producing the negative consequences often suggested in the literature. We find evidence for an important aspect that has not been widely discussed in prior studies: remittances foster the formation of social capital by increasing the amount of money that households give as gifts to other households. 4aConsumer Economics: Empirical Analysis         b(D12) 4aRemittances         b(F24) 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aGeorgia  aExpenditure  a Health  a Household Economics  a Households  a Remittances  a Saving  a Social Capital  a Well Being  a Well-being  aJournal Article  g50g4h1279-1301tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302343naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002162450070002241000018002941100009003125201018003216500038013396500077013776500084014546500076015386500109016146510011017236530013017346530018017476530013017656530012017786530015017906530015018056530015018206530013018356550020018487730031018688560006018999030016019051387706  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0187-8  aI12  aJ11  aJ12  aJ13  aO1510aMigration and Father Absence: Shifting Family Structure in Mexico10aNobles, Jenna  aU WI  aDespite many changing demographic processes in Mexico--declining adult mortality, rising divorce, and rising nonmarital fertility--Mexican children's family structure has been most affected by rising migration rates. Data from five national surveys spanning three decades demonstrate that since 1976, migration has shifted from the least common to the most common form of father household absence. Presently, more than 1 in 5 children experience a father's migration by age 15; 1 in 11 experiences his departure to the United States. The proportions are significantly higher among those children born in rural communities and those born to less-educated mothers. The findings emphasize the importance of framing migration as a family process with implications for children's living arrangements and attendant well-being, particularly in resource-constrained countries. The stability of children's family life in these regions constitutes a substantial but poorly measured cost of worldwide increases in migration. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMexico  aChildren  a Demographics  a Divorce  a Family  a Fertility  a Migration  a Mortality  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g50g4h1303-14tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302194naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002082450057002161000022002737000018002951100017003137100020003305200949003506500038012996500084013376500076014216500113014976530010016106530014016206530012016346530013016466530014016596530015016736530013016886530010017016550020017117730031017318560006017629030016017681387707  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0211-7  aI12  aJ12  aJ13  aJ1510aSelection and the Marriage Premium for Infant Health10aBuckles, Kasey S.10aPrice, Joseph  aU Notre Dame  aBrigham Young U  aPrevious research has found a positive relationship between marriage and infant health, but it is unclear whether this relationship is causal or a reflection of positive selection into marriage. We use multiple empirical approaches to address this issue. First, using a technique developed by Gelbach (2009) to determine the relative importance of observable characteristics, we show how selection into marriage has changed over time. Second, we construct a matched sample of children born to the same mother and apply panel data techniques to account for time-invariant unobserved characteristics. We find evidence of a sizable marriage premium. However, this premium fell by more than 40% between 1989 and 2004, largely as a result of declining selection into marriage by race. Accounting for selection reduces ordinary least squares estimates of the marriage premiums for birth weight, prematurity, and infant mortality by at least one-half. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aBirth  a Children  a Health  a Infants  a Marriage  a Mortality  a Mothers  a Race  aJournal Article  g50g4h1315-39tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302490naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001922450085002001000019002857000026003047000020003301100016003507100036003667100041004025201451004436500038018946500066019326510016019986530013020146530012020276530015020396530013020546550020020677730031020878560006021189030016021241387708  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0185-x  aI12  aJ1610aIncluding the Smoking Epidemic in Internationally Coherent Mortality Projections10aJanssen, Fanny10avan Wissen, Leo J. G.10aKunst, Anton E.  aU Groningen  aU Groningen and NIDI, The Hague  aAcademic Medical Center, U Amsterdam  aWe present a new mortality projection methodology that distinguishes smoking- and non-smoking-related mortality and takes into account mortality trends of the opposite sex and in other countries. We evaluate to what extent future projections of life expectancy at birth (e[subscript 0]) for the Netherlands up to 2040 are affected by the application of these components. All-cause mortality and non-smoking-related mortality for the years 1970-2006 are projected by the Lee-Carter and Li-Lee methodologies. Smoking-related mortality is projected according to assumptions on future smoking-attributable mortality. Projecting all-cause mortality in the Netherlands, using the Lee-Carter model, leads to high gains in e[subscript 0] (4.1 for males; 4.4 for females) and divergence between the sexes. Coherent projections, which include the mortality experience of the other 21 sex- and country-specific populations, result in much higher gains for males (6.4) and females (5.7), and convergence. The separate projection of smoking and non-smoking-related mortality produces a steady increase in e[subscript 0] for males (4.8) and a nonlinear trend for females, with lower gains in e[subscript 0] in the short run, resulting in temporary sex convergence. The latter effect is also found in coherent projections. Our methodology provides more robust projections, especially thanks to the distinction between smoking- and non-smoking-related mortality. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aNetherlands  aEpidemic  a Female  a Mortality  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g50g4h1341-62tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302467naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002160430008002242450096002321000021003287000021003491100009003707100022003795200944004016500117013456500038014626500073015006500108015736500066016816500109017476510011018566530010018676530012018776530019018896530016019086530013019246530011019376550020019487730031019688560006019999030016020051387709  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0199-z  aH23  aI12  aI18  aJ14  aJ16  aO1510aIs Health of the Aging Improved by Conditional Cash Transfer Programs?

Whereas nearly all studies of their effects have focused on youth, CCT programs may also have an impact on aging adults by increasing household resources or inducing changes in allocations of time of household members, which may be of substantial interest, particularly given the rapid aging of most populations. This article contributes to this underresearched area by examining health and work impacts on the aging for the best-known and most influential of these programs, the Mexican PROGRESA/Oportunidades program. For a number of health indicators, the program appears to significantly improve health, with larger effects for recipients with a greater time receiving benefits from the program. Most of these health effects are concentrated on women. 4aTaxation and Subsidies: Externalities; Redistributive Effects; Environmental Taxes and Subsidies         b(H23) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMexico  aAging  a Health  a Human Capital  a Population  a Poverty  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g4h1363-86tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302672naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002002450090002081000026002987000023003247000020003477000019003677000022003861100035004087100035004437100035004787100012005137100012005255201250005376500084017876500076018716500109019476510016020566530010020726530011020826530018020936530015021116530013021266530014021396550020021537730031021738560006022049030016022101387710  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0179-8  aJ12  aJ13  aO1510aMultidimensional Life Table Estimation of the Total Fertility Rate and Its Components10aRetherford, Robert D.20aEini-Zinab, Hassan10aChoe, Minja Kim10aOgawa, Naohiro10aMatsukura, Rikiya  aEast-West Center, Honolulu, HI  aEast-West Center, Honolulu, HI  aEast-West Center, Honolulu, HI  aNihon U  aNihon U  aUsing discrete-time survival models of parity progression and illustrative data from the Philippines, this article develops a multivariate multidimensional life table of nuptiality and fertility, the dimensions of which are age, parity, and duration in parity. The measures calculated from this life table include total fertility rate (TFR), total marital fertility rate (TMFR), parity progression ratios (PPR), age-specific fertility rates, mean and median ages at first marriage, mean and median closed birth intervals, and mean and median ages at childbearing by child's birth order and for all birth orders combined. These measures are referred to collectively as "TFR and its components." Because the multidimensional life table is multivariate, all measures derived from it are also multivariate in the sense that they can be tabulated by categories or selected values of one socioeconomic variable while controlling for other socioeconomic variables. The methodology is applied to birth history data, in the form of actual birth histories from a fertility survey or reconstructed birth histories derived from a census or household survey. The methodology yields period estimates as well as cohort estimates of the aforementioned measures. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aPhilippines  aBirth  a Child  a Childbearing  a Fertility  a Marital  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g50g4h1387-95tDemography  iN  aAugust 201301113naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001922450099002001000026002997000023003257000020003487000019003687000022003871100035004097100035004447100035004797100012005147100012005266500077005386500076006156530014006916550020007057730028007258560006007539030016007591387711  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0206-4  aJ11  aJ1310aMultidimensional Life Table Estimation of the Total Fertility Rate and Its Components: Erratum10aRetherford, Robert D.20aEini-Zinab, Hassan10aChoe, Minja Kim10aOgawa, Naohiro10aMatsukura, Rikiya  aEast-West Center, Honolulu, HI  aEast-West Center, Honolulu, HI  aEast-West Center, Honolulu, HI  aNihon U  aNihon U 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aFertility  aJournal Article  g50g4h1397tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302364naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002002450112002081000019003207000023003397000019003627000024003811100015004057100015004207100071004357100015005065201073005216500065015946500076016596500066017356510012018016530013018136530015018266530012018416530015018536530011018686550020018797730033018998560006019329030016019381387712  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0186-9  aI20  aJ13  aJ1610aEducational Differences in Completed Fertility: A Behavioral Genetic Study of Finnish Male and Female Twins10aNisen, Jessica10aMartikainen, Pekka10aKaprio, Jaakko10aSilventoinen, Karri  aU Helsinki  aU Helsinki  aU Helsinki and National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki  aU Helsinki  aDespite the large body of research on educational differences in fertility, how genetic and environmental influences may contribute to educational differences in completed fertility is not well understood. This study examines the association between educational level and completed fertility in a sample of Finnish male and female twins born between 1950 and 1957 with register-based fertility follow-up until 2009. The results show that poorly educated men and highly educated women are least likely to have any children and have lower completed fertility in general. Behavioral genetics analysis suggests that the association between education and having any children in both sexes is influenced by factors shared by co-twins and that these factors are genetic rather than common environmental. No evidence of a causal pathway between education and having any children independent of these shared influences is found. These findings suggest that familial factors may play a role in the process through which educational differences in completed fertility are formed. 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aFinland  aChildren  a Education  a Female  a Fertility  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g4h1399-1420tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302493naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001922450060002001000023002607000024002837000027003071100009003347100009003437100015003525201378003676500076017456500113018216510009019346530010019436530011019536530018019646530015019826530016019976530010020136530011020236550020020347730031020548560006020859030016020911387713  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0201-9  aJ13  aJ1510aExamining the Antecedents of U.S. Nonmarital Fatherhood10aCarlson, Marcia J.10aVanOrman, Alicia G.10aPilkauskas, Natasha V.  aU WI  aU WI  aColumbia U  aDespite the dramatic rise in U.S. nonmarital childbearing in recent decades, limited attention has been paid to factors affecting nonmarital fatherhood (beyond studies of young fathers). In this article, we use data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort to examine the antecedents of nonmarital fatherhood, as compared to marital fatherhood. Overall, we find the strongest support across both data sets for education and race/ethnicity as key predictors of having a nonmarital first birth, consistent with prior literature about women's nonmarital childbearing and about men's early/teenage fatherhood. Education is inversely related to the risk of nonmarital fatherhood, and minority (especially black) men are much more likely to have a child outside of marriage than white men. We find little evidence that employment predicts nonmarital fertility, although it does strongly (and positively) predict marital fertility. High predicted earnings are also associated with a greater likelihood of marital childbearing but with a lower likelihood of nonmarital childbearing. Given the socioeconomic disadvantage associated with nonmarital fatherhood, this research suggests that nonmarital fatherhood may be an important aspect of growing U.S. inequality and stratification both within and across generations. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Child  a Childbearing  a Fertility  a Inequality  a Race  a Youth  aJournal Article  g50g4h1421-47tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302488naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002002450139002081000018003477000026003657000028003911100009004197100009004287100009004375201303004466500071017496500084018206500076019046510009019806530010019896530014019996530016020136530012020296550020020417730031020618560006020929030016020981387714  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0196-2  aD13  aJ12  aJ1310aGrowing Parental Economic Power in Parent-Adult Child Households: Coresidence and Financial Dependency in the United States, 1960-201010aKahn, Joan R.10aGoldscheider, Frances20aGarcia-Manglano, Javier  aU MD  aU MD  aU MD  aResearch on coresidence between parents and their adult children in the United States has challenged the myth that elders are the primary beneficiaries, instead showing that intergenerationally extended households generally benefit the younger generation more than their parents. Nevertheless, the economic fortunes of those at the older and younger ends of the adult life course have shifted in the second half of the twentieth century, with increasing financial well-being among older adults and greater financial strain among younger adults. This article uses U.S. census and American Community Survey (ACS) data to examine the extent to which changes in generational financial well-being over the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have been reflected in the likelihood of coresidence and financial dependency in parent-adult child U.S. households between 1960 and 2010. We find that younger adults have become more financially dependent on their parents and that while older adults have become more financially independent of their adult children, they nevertheless coreside with their needy adult children. We also find that the effect of economic considerations in decisions about coresidence became increasingly salient for younger adults, but decreasingly so for older adults. 4aHousehold Production and Intrahousehold Allocation         b(D13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Households  a Parent  aJournal Article  g50g4h1449-75tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302535naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002000430008002080430008002162450071002241000023002957000020003187000016003381100019003547100063003737100019004365200976004556500055014316500084014866500113015706500172016836500098018556510009019536530011019626530018019736530014019916530010020056530013020156550020020287730031020488560006020799030016020851387715  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0184-y  aD14  aJ12  aJ15  aR23  aZ1310aHousing Tenure and Residential Segregation in Metropolitan America10aFriedman, Samantha10aTsao, Hui-shien10aChen, Cheng  aU Albany, SUNY  aCenter for Social and Demographic Analysis, U Albany, SUNY  aU Albany, SUNY  aHomeownership, a symbol of the American dream, is one of the primary ways through which families accumulate wealth, particularly for blacks and Hispanics. Surprisingly, no study has explicitly documented the segregation of minority owners and renters from whites. Using data from Census 2000, this study aims to fill this gap. Analyses here reveal that the segregation of black renters relative to whites is significantly lower than the segregation of black owners from whites, controlling for relevant socioeconomic and demographic factors, contrary to the notion that homeownership represents an endpoint in the residential assimilation process. The patterns for Hispanics and Asians conform more to expectations under the spatial assimilation model. The findings here suggest that race and ethnicity continue to be as important in shaping residential segregation as socioeconomic status, and raise concerns about the benefits of homeownership, particularly for blacks. 4aHousehold Saving; Personal Finance         b(D14) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Demographics  a Families  a Race  a Spatial  aJournal Article  g50g4h1477-98tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302289naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760370048001360430008001840430008001920430008002002450080002081000022002881100016003105201259003266500065015856500084016506500066017346510011018006530011018116530016018226530013018386530014018516530011018656550020018767730033018968560006019299030016019351387716  a201308       201308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0229-x  aI20  aJ12  aJ1613aThe Educational Gradient in Marriage: A Comparison of 25 European Countries10aKalmijn, Matthijs  aU Amsterdam  aPrevious research has suggested that a new marriage gradient has emerged in the United States, with marriage becoming increasingly the privilege of the better-educated. This article examines whether this is true for Europe and explores differences in the marriage gradient among 25 European countries, using multilevel models. The focus is on the chances of living in a marital (or cohabiting) union during midlife (ages 40-49). Multilevel analyses show that the direction and strength of the gradient depend on the societal context. In countries where gender roles are traditional, better-educated women are less likely to be married than less-educated women; in gender-egalitarian countries, better-educated women are more likely to be married. For men, the educational effect on marriage is absent in traditional countries but becomes positive as gender roles become more equal. Inequality in a society also modifies the gradient: if the degree of economic inequality between educational groups in a society is strong, better-educated men are more likely to be married than less-educated men. In general, the results suggest that there may be an accumulation of social and economic disadvantages for the less well educated in more-developed countries. 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aEurope  aGender  a Inequality  a Marital  a Marriage  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g4h1499-1520tDemography  iN  aAugust 201302630naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450076002151000023002917000023003147000021003377000020003581100009003787100068003877100041004557100056004965201210005526500059017626500077018216510011018986530010019096530014019196530016019336530016019496550020019657730031019858560006020168560196020229030014022181372578  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516636  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0193-x  aC53  aJ1110aBayesian Probabilistic Projections of Life Expectancy for All Countries10aRaftery, Adrian E.10aChunn, Jennifer L.10aGerland, Patrick10aSevcikova, Hana  aU WA  aMathematics and Statistics Help Center, James Cook U, Singapore  aUN Population Division, New York, NY  aCenter for Statistics and the Social Sciences, U WA  aWe propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for producing probabilistic forecasts of male period life expectancy at birth for all the countries of the world to 2100.

To evaluate the method, we conducted an out-of-sample cross-validation experiment, fitting the model to the data from 1950-1995 and using the estimated model to forecast for the subsequent 10 years. The 10-year predictions had a mean absolute error of about 1 year, about 40 percent less than the current UN methodology. The probabilistic forecasts were calibrated in the sense that, for example, the 80 percent prediction intervals contained the truth about 80 percent of the time. We illustrate our method with results from Madagascar (a typical country with steadily improving life expectancy), Latvia (a country that has had a mortality crisis), and Japan (a leading country). We also show aggregated results for South Asia, a region with eight countries. Free, publicly available R software packages called bayesLife and bayesDem are available to implement the method. 4aForecasting Models; Simulation Methods         b(C53) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aGlobal  aBirth  a Forecast  a Population  a Prediction  aJournal Article  g50g3h777-801tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372578&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201302783naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450060002231000020002837000020003037000016003237000019003391100011003587100025003697100025003947100009004195201358004286500038017866500084018246500076019086510009019846530010019936530015020036530014020186530012020326530012020446530015020566550020020717730030020918560006021218560196021279030014023231372579  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516643  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0162-4  aI12  aJ12  aJ1311aA Sibling Death in the Family: Common and Consequential10aFletcher, Jason10aMailick, Marsha10aSong, Jieun10aWolfe, Barbara  aYale U  aWaisman Center, U WI  aWaisman Center, U WI  aU WI  aAlthough a large literature analyzes the determinants of child mortality and suggests policy and medical interventions aimed at its reduction, there is little existing analysis illuminating the consequences of child mortality for other family members. In particular, there is little evidence exploring the consequences of experiencing the death of a sibling on one's own development and transition to adulthood. This article examines the prevalence and consequences of experiencing a sibling death during one's childhood using two U.S. data sets. We show that even in a rich developed country, these experiences are quite common, affecting between 5 percent and 8 percent of the children with one or more siblings in our two data sets. We then show that these experiences are associated with important reductions in years of schooling as well as a broad range of adult socioeconomic outcomes. Our findings also suggest that sisters are far more affected than brothers and that the cause of death is an important factor in sibling effects. Overall, our findings point to important previously unexamined consequences of child mortality, adding to the societal costs associated with childhood mortality as well as suggesting additional benefits from policy and medical innovations aimed at curbing both such deaths and subsequent effects on family members. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Childhood  a Children  a Deaths  a Family  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g50g3h803-26tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372579&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201303373naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450113002231000013003367000021003497000020003707000014003901100024004047100011004287100089004397100060005285201857005886500059024456500059025046500084025636510009026476530011026566530014026676530016026816550020026977730030027178560006027478560196027539030014029491372580  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516644  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0171-3  aC53  aD12  aJ1210aHousehold and Living Arrangement Projections at the Subnational Level: An Extended Cohort-Component Approach10aZeng, Yi10aLand, Kenneth C.10aWang, Zhenglian10aGu, Danan  aDuke U and Peking U  aDuke U  aPopulation Research Institute, Duke U and Household and Consumption Forecasting, Inc  aCenter for Study of Aging and Human Development, Duke U  aThis article presents the core methodological ideas and empirical assessments of an extended cohort-component approach (known as the "ProFamy model"), and applications to simultaneously project household composition, living arrangements, and population sizes-gender structures at the subnational level in the United States. Comparisons of projections from 1990 to 2000 using this approach with census counts in 2000 for each of the 50 states and Washington, DC show that 68.0%, 17.0%, 11.2%, and 3.8% of the absolute percentage errors are <3.0%, 3.0% to 4.99%, 5.0% to 9.99%, and >=10.0%, respectively. Another analysis compares average forecast errors between the extended cohort-component approach and the still widely used classic headship-rate method, by projecting number-of-bedrooms-specific housing demands from 1990 to 2000 and then comparing those projections with census counts in 2000 for each of the 50 states and Washington, DC. The results demonstrate that, compared with the extended cohort-component approach, the headship-rate method produces substantially more serious forecast errors because it cannot project households by size while the extended cohort-component approach projects detailed household sizes. We also present illustrative household and living arrangement projections for the five decades from 2000 to 2050, with medium-, small-, and large-family scenarios for each of the 50 states; Washington, DC; six counties of southern California; and the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. Among many interesting numerical outcomes of household and living arrangement projections with medium, low, and high bounds, the aging of American households over the next few decades across all states/areas is particularly striking. Finally, the limitations of the present study and potential future lines of research are discussed. 4aForecasting Models; Simulation Methods         b(C53) 4aConsumer Economics: Empirical Analysis         b(D12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aFamily  a Forecast  a Households  aJournal Article  g50g3h827-52tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372580&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201302796naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002312450081002391000021003201100009003415201351003506500038017016500084017396500076018236500066018996500109019656510010020746530013020846530012020976530012021096530011021216550020021327730030021528560006021828560196021889030014023841372581  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516642  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0173-1  aI12  aJ12  aJ13  aJ16  aO1510aGoing Nuclear? Family Structure and Young Women's Health in India, 1992-200610aAllendorf, Keera  aU IL  aScholars traditionally argued that industrialization, urbanization, and educational expansion lead to a decline in extended families and complementary rise in nuclear families. Some have suggested that such transitions are good for young married women because living in nuclear families benefits their health. However, extended families may also present advantages for young women's health that outweigh any disadvantages. Using the Indian National Family Health Survey, this article examines whether young married women living in nuclear families have better health than those in patrilocal extended families. It also examines whether young married women's living arrangements are changing over time and, if so, how such changes will affect their health. Results show that young married women living in nuclear families do not have better health than those in patrilocal extended families. Of eight health outcomes examined, only five differ significantly by family structure. Further, of the five outcomes that differ, four are patrilocal extended-family advantages and only one is a nuclear-family advantage. From 1992 to 2006, the percentage of young married women residing in nuclear families increased, although the majority remained in patrilocal extended families. This trend toward nuclear families will not benefit young women's health. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aIndia  aFamilies  a Family  a Health  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g3h853-80tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372581&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201302411naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450103002151000019003187000026003377000018003631100014003817100014003957100030004095201167004396500084016066500066016906510016017566530011017726530011017836550020017947730031018148560006018458560196018519030014020471372582  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516650  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0191-z  aJ12  aJ1610aParametric and Nonparametric Analysis of Life Courses: An Application to Family Formation Patterns10aBonetti, Marco10aPiccarreta, Raffaella10aSalford, Gaia  aBocconi U  aBocconi U  aSantander Private Banking  aWe discuss a unified approach to the description and explanation of life course patterns represented as sequences of states observed in discrete time. In particular, we study life course data collected as part of the Dutch Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS) to learn about the family formation behavior of 1,897 women born between 1953 and 1962. Retrospective monthly data were available on each 18- to 30-year-old woman living either with or without children as single, married, or cohabiting. We first study via a nonparametric approach which factors explain the pairwise dissimilarities observed between life courses. Permutation distribution inference allows for the study of the statistical significance of the effect of a set of covariates of interest. We then develop a parametric model for the sequence-generating process that can be used to describe state transitions and durations conditional on covariates and conditional on having observed an initial segment of the trajectory. Fitting of the proposed model and the corresponding model selection process are based on the observed data likelihood. We discuss the application of the methods to the FFS. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aNetherlands  aFamily  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g3h881-902tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372582&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201302212naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450114002231000021003377000019003587000020003771100108003977100065005057100026005705200610005966500084012066500108012906500066013986510011014646530010014756530014014856530012014996530013015116530012015246550020015367730030015568560006015868560196015929030014017881372583  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516639  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0181-1  aJ12  aJ14  aJ1610aMeet the Parents?

Our main results show that adult children in Sweden are not constrained by sibship size in choosing where to live: for families with more than one child, sibship size does not affect child-mother proximity. For aging parents, however, having fewer children reduces the probability of having at least one child living nearby, which is likely to have consequences for the intensity of intergenerational contact and eldercare. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aSweden  aAging  a Families  a Family  a Mothers  a Parent  aJournal Article  g50g3h903-31tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372583&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201302152naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001992450050002071000017002577000018002741100031002927100017003235201109003406500076014496510009015256530013015346530011015476530014015586550020015727730030015928560006016228560196016289030014018241372584  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516640  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0166-0  aJ1310aEconomic Incentives and Foster Child Adoption10aArgys, Laura10aDuncan, Brian  aU CO, Denver and IZA, Bonn  aU CO, Denver  aEvery year, a large number of children in the United States enter the foster care system. Many of them are eventually reunited with their biological parents or quickly adopted. A significant number, however, face long-term foster care, and some of these children are eventually adopted by their foster parents. The decision by foster parents to adopt their foster child carries significant economic consequences, including forfeiting foster care payments while also assuming responsibility for medical, legal, and educational expenses, to name a few. Since 1980, U.S. states have begun to offer adoption subsidies to offset some of these expenses, significantly lowering the cost of adopting a child who is in the foster care system. This article presents empirical evidence of the role that these economic incentives play in foster parents' decision of when, or if, to adopt their foster child. We find that adoption subsidies increase adoptions through two distinct price mechanisms: by lowering the absolute cost of adoption, and by lowering the relative cost of adoption versus long-term foster care. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAdoption  a Child  a Children  aJournal Article  g50g3h933-54tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372584&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201301843naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450077002151000022002927000023003147000018003371100019003557100016003747100020003905200568004106500084009786500076010626530010011386530015011486530014011636530014011776530012011916550020012037730030012238560006012538560196012599030014014551372585  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516646  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0169-x  aJ12  aJ1310aNontraditional Families and Childhood Progress through School: A Comment10aAllen, Douglas W.10aPakaluk, Catherine10aPrice, Joseph  aSimon Fraser U  aAve Maria U  aBrigham Young U  aWe reexamine Rosenfeld's (2010) study on the association between child outcomes and same-sex family structure.

I construct a gauge of the relative supply of men for women of different age groups based on state-level male and female population counts and the empirically observed propensity of men of specific ages to marry women of specific ages. Using Mexican census data from 1960 through 2000, I estimate a series of models in which the dependent variable is the intercensus change in an average outcome for Mexican women measured by state and for specific age groups, and the key explanatory variable is the change in the relative supply of men to women in that state/age group. I find that the declining relative supply of males positively and significantly affects the proportion of women who have never been married as well as the proportion of women who have never had a child. In addition, states experiencing the largest declines in the relative supply of men also experience relatively large increases in female educational attainment and female employment rates. However, I find little evidence that women who do marry match to men who are younger or less educated than themselves. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMexico  aCensus  a Child  a Demographics  a Female  a Fertility  a International Migration  a Marital  a Migration  a Population  a Schooling  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g3h971-91tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372587&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201302578naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450112002311000018003437000027003611100015003887100009004035201217004126500038016296500042016676500077017096500066017866510009018526530009018616530015018706530016018856530011019016550020019127730032019328560006019648560196019709030014021661372588  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516635  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0174-0  aI12  aI14  aJ11  aJ1610aSocial Patterning in Body Mass Index (BMI) among Contemporary Immigrant Groups: The Emergence of a Gradient10aFrank, Reanne10aAkresh, Ilana Redstone  aOH State U  aU IL  aAlthough adult body mass index (BMI) displays considerable social patterning worldwide, the direction and strength of the relationship between BMI and socioeconomic status (SES) varies cross nationally. We examine social gradients in BMI for contemporary U.S. immigrants and evaluate whether their SES-BMI gradient patterns are shaped by underlying gradients in immigrant origin countries and whether they are further patterned by time in the United States. Data come from the New Immigrant Survey, the only nationally representative survey of contemporary immigrants. Results indicate that the inverse SES-BMI gradients observed among this population are strongest among women originating in highly developed countries. After arrival in the United States, however, inverse gradient patterns are driven largely by higher weights among low-SES individuals, particularly those from less-developed countries. We conclude that although certain immigrants appear to be uniquely protected from weight gain, poorer individuals from less-developed countries are doubly disadvantaged; this raises concerns about worsening inequalities in both diet and behavior between the rich and poor upon arrival to the United States. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth and Inequality         b(I14) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aDiet  a Immigrant  a Population  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g3h993-1012tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372588&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201302186naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450088002151000019003037000019003227000022003411100009003637100015003727100025003875200941004126500084013536500098014376510009015356530012015446530013015566550020015697730031015898560006016208560196016269030014018221372589  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516651  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0180-2  aJ12  aZ1310aDoes Culture Affect Divorce?

Because childhood-arriving immigrants are all exposed to a common set of U.S. laws and institutions, we interpret relationships between their divorce tendencies and home-country divorce rates as evidence of the effect of culture. Our results are robust to controlling for several home-country variables, including average church attendance and gross domestic product (GDP). Moreover, specifications with country-of-origin fixed effects suggest that immigrants from countries with low divorce rates are especially less likely to be divorced if they reside among a large number of coethnics. Supplemental analyses indicate that divorce culture has a stronger impact on the divorce decisions of females than of males, pointing to a potentially gendered nature of divorce taboos. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aU.S.  aCulture  a Divorce  aJournal Article  g50g3h1013-38tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372589&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201302930naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450107002231000023003307000017003537000021003701100009003917100020004007100009004205201437004296500038018666500077019046500109019816510017020906530013021076530016021206530012021366530015021486530013021636530015021766530013021916530013022046550020022177730031022378560006022688560196022749030014024701372590  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516632  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0178-9  aI12  aJ11  aO1510aMigration Selection, Protection, and Acculturation in Health: A Binational Perspective on Older Adults10aRiosmena, Fernando10aWong, Rebeca10aPalloni, Alberto  aU CO  aU TX, Galveston  aU WI  aIn this article, we test for four potential explanations of the Hispanic Health Paradox (HHP): the "salmon bias," emigration selection, and sociocultural protection originating in either destination or sending country. To reduce biases related to attrition by return migration typical of most U.S.-based surveys, we combine data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study in Mexico and the U.S. National Health Interview Survey to compare self-reported diabetes, hypertension, current smoking, obesity, and self-rated health among Mexican-born men ages 50 and older according to their previous U.S. migration experience, and U.S.-born Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites. We also use height, a measure of health during childhood, to bolster some of our tests. We find an immigrant advantage relative to non-Hispanic whites in hypertension and, to a lesser extent, obesity. We find evidence consistent with emigration selection and the salmon bias in height, hypertension, and self-rated health among immigrants with less than 15 years of experience in the United States; we do not find conclusive evidence consistent with sociocultural protection mechanisms. Finally, we illustrate that although ignoring return migrants when testing for the HHP and its mechanisms, as well as for the association between U.S. experience and health, exaggerates these associations, they are not fully driven by return migration-related attrition. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMexico; U.S.  aDiabetes  a Emigration  a Health  a Immigrant  a Migrant  a Migration  a Obesity  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g50g3h1039-64tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372590&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201300790naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001992450018002071000020002251100009002456500042002546550020002967730028003168560006003448560196003509030014005461372591  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516649  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0217-1  aY2010aEditor's Note10aTolnay, Stewart  aU WA 4aIntroductory Material         b(Y20)  aJournal Article  g50g3h1065tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372591&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201302609naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450072002231000030002957000024003257000028003491100022003777100022003997100009004215201167004306500077015976500057016746500109017316510017018406530011018576530017018686530015018856530017019006530015019176550020019327730031019528560006019838560196019899030014021851372592  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516647  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0200-x  aJ11  aJ18  aO1510aHow Do Tougher Immigration Measures Affect Unauthorized Immigrants?20aAmuedo-Dorantes, Catalina10aPuttitanun, Thitima20aMartinez-Donate, Ana P.  aSan Diego State U  aSan Diego State U  aU WI  aThe recent impetus of tougher immigration-related measures passed at the state level raises concerns about the impact of such measures on the migration experience, trajectory, and future plans of unauthorized immigrants. In a recent and unique survey of Mexican unauthorized immigrants interviewed upon their voluntary return or deportation to Mexico, almost a third reported experiencing difficulties in obtaining social or government services, finding legal assistance, or obtaining health care services. Additionally, half of these unauthorized immigrants reported fearing deportation. When we assess how the enactment of punitive measures against unauthorized immigrants, such as E-Verify mandates, has affected their migration experience, we find no evidence of a statistically significant association between these measures and the difficulties reported by unauthorized immigrants in accessing a variety of services. However, the enactment of these mandates infuses deportation fear, reduces interstate mobility among voluntary returnees during their last migration spell, and helps curb deportees' intent to return to the United States in the near future. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aDemographic Economics: Public Policy         b(J18) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMexico; U.S.  aHealth  a Health Care  a Immigrant  a Immigration  a Migration  aJournal Article  g50g3h1067-91tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372592&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201301121naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450042002231000023002651100016002886500077003046500057003816500109004386510017005476550020005647730031005848560006006158560196006219030014008171372593  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516652  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0204-6  aJ11  aJ18  aO1510aComment: Building a Better Underclass10aMassey, Douglas S.  aPrinceton U 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aDemographic Economics: Public Policy         b(J18) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMexico; U.S.  aJournal Article  g50g3h1093-95tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372593&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201301029naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450067002151000022002821100015003046500077003196500057003966530014004536530017004676550020004847730031005048560006005358560196005419030014007371372594  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516638  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0205-5  aJ11  aJ1810aWhen Immigration Policies Affect Immigrants' Lives: Commentary10aMenjivar, Cecilia  aAZ State U 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aDemographic Economics: Public Policy         b(J18)  aImmigrant  a Immigration  aJournal Article  g50g3h1097-99tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372594&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201301076naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450081002151000021002961100049003176500077003666500057004436530014005006530017005146550020005317730031005518560006005828560196005889030014007841372595  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516633  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0207-3  aJ11  aJ1810aHow Do Tougher Immigration Measures Affect Unauthorized Immigrants?: Comment10aOrrenius, Pia M.  aFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas and IZA, Bonn 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aDemographic Economics: Public Policy         b(J18)  aImmigrant  a Immigration  aJournal Article  g50g3h1101-03tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372595&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201302186naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450083002151000023002987000026003217000024003477000020003717000027003917000017004181100016004357100016004517100023004677100016004907100033005067100025005395200735005646500048012996500077013476530011014246530018014356530016014536530016014696550020014857730031015058560006015368560196015429030014017381372596  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516648  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0175-z  aI31  aJ1110aNew Approaches to Human Mobility: Using Mobile Phones for Demographic Research10aPalmer, John R.

It describes a pilot study (the Human Mobility Project) in which volunteers around the world were successfully recruited to share GPS and cellular tower information on their trajectories and respond to dynamic, location-based surveys using an open-source Android application. The pilot study illustrates the great potential of mobile phone methodology for moving spatial measures beyond residential census units and investigating a range of important social phenomena, including the heterogeneity of activity spaces, the dynamic nature of spatial segregation, and the contextual dependence of subjective well-being. 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aCensus  a Demographics  a Well Being  a Well-being  aJournal Article  g50g3h1105-28tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372596&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201302912naa  2200493   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450058002311000022002897000021003117000019003327000021003511100098003727100045004707100045005157100082005605201055006426500073016976500076017706500066018466500109019126510010020216530010020316530011020416530014020526530020020666530012020866530012020986530027021106530014021376550020021517730031021718560006022028560196022089030014024041372597  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516645  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0194-9  aI18  aJ13  aJ16  aO1510aSkewed Sex Ratios in India: 'Physician, Heal Thyself'10aPatel, Archana B.10aBadhoniya, Neetu10aMamtani, Manju10aKulkarni, Hemant  aLata Medical Research Foundation, Nagpur and Indira Gandhi Government Medical College, Nagpur  aLata Medical Research Foundation, Nagpur  aLata Medical Research Foundation, Nagpur  aLata Medical Research Foundation, Nagpur and TX Biomedical Research Institute  aSex selection, a gender discrimination of the worst kind, is highly prevalent across all strata of Indian society. Physicians have a crucial role in this practice and implementation of the Indian Government's Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act in 1996 to prevent the misuse of ultrasound techniques for the purpose of prenatal sex determination. Little is known about family preferences, let alone preferences among families of physicians. We investigated the sex ratios in 946 nuclear families with 1,624 children, for which either one or both parents were physicians. The overall child sex ratio was more skewed than the national average of 914. The conditional sex ratios decreased with increasing number of previous female births, and a previous birth of a daughter in the family was associated with a 38 percent reduced likelihood of a subsequent female birth. The heavily skewed sex ratios in the families of physicians are indicative of a deeply rooted social malady that could pose a critical challenge in correcting the sex ratios in India. 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aIndia  aBirth  a Child  a Children  a Discrimination  a Female  a Gender  a Gender Discrimination  a Prenatal  aJournal Article  g50g3h1129-34tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372597&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201301958naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450076001671000021002437000018002641100022002827100022003045200824003266500076011506500066012266510011012926530010013036530014013136530015013276530011013426550020013537730031013738560006014048560196014109030014016061372598  a201306       201306                        eng     aEP87516637  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1610aSocioeconomic Differences in Multipartner Fertility among Norwegian Men10aLappegard, Trude10aRonsen, Marit  aStatistics Norway  aStatistics Norway  aThis article analyzes male fertility, with a particular focus on multipartner fertility, for cohorts born 1955 to 1984 in Norway. We find that socioeconomically disadvantaged men have the lowest chance of becoming fathers and the lowest likelihood of fathering multiple children in stable unions. Multipartner fertility, on the other hand, is positively associated with both disadvantage and advantage: higher-order birth risks with a new partner are more prevalent among men with low as well as high socioeconomic status. An intervening factor among disadvantaged men may be a higher union dissolution risk, and an elevated risk among advantaged men may be associated with their higher preferences for children and other features that make these men more attractive to women as partners and fathers of future children. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aNorway  aBirth  a Children  a Fertility  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g3h1135-53tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1372598&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aJune 201303250naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002312450075002391000023003141100014003375201660003516500069020116500094020806500056021746500077022306500113023076510009024206530017024296530016024466530016024626530011024786530010024896530016024996530010025156530012025256550020025377730030025578560006025878560196025939030015027891360656  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212920  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0197-1  aD31  aD63  aI32  aJ11  aJ1510aIntegration or Fragmentation? Racial Diversity and the American Future10aLichter, Daniel T.  aCornell U  aOver the next generation or two, America's older, largely white population will increasingly be replaced by today's disproportionately poor minority children. All future growth will come from populations other than non-Hispanic whites as America moves toward a majority-minority society by 2043. This so-called Third Demographic Transition raises important implications about changing racial boundaries in the United States, that is, about the physical, economic, and sociocultural barriers that separate different racial and ethnic groups. America's racial transformation may place upward demographic pressure on future poverty and inequality as today's disproportionately poor and minority children grow into adult roles. Racial boundaries will be reshaped by the changing meaning of race and ethnicity, shifting patterns of racial segregation in neighborhoods and the workplace, newly integrating (or not) friendship networks, and changing rates of interracial marriage and childbearing. The empirical literature provides complicated lessons and offers few guarantees that growing racial diversity will lead to a corresponding breakdown in racial boundaries--that whites and minorities will increasingly share the same physical and social spaces or interact as coequals. How America's older population of elected officials and taxpayers responds today to America's increasingly diverse population will provide a window to the future, when today's children successfully transition (or not) into productive adult roles. Racial and ethnic inclusion will be reshaped by changing ethnoracial inequality, which highlights the need to invest in children--now. 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aEquity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement         b(D63) 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Inequality  a Minorities  a Needs  a Poor  a Population  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g50g2h359-91tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360656&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201302769naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450063002311000020002947000021003147000016003351100022003517100009003737100009003825201171003916500084015626500113016466500066017596500172018256530011019976530012020086530014020206530010020346530012020446530011020566550020020677730031020878560006021188560196021249030015023201360657  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212911  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0158-0  aJ12  aJ15  aJ16  aR2310aGender and the Neighborhood Location of Mixed-Race Couples10aWright, Richard10aHolloway, Steven10aEllis, Mark  aDartmouth College  aU GA  aU WA  aGender asymmetry in mixed-race heterosexual partnerships and marriages is common. For instance, black men marry or partner with white women at a far higher rate than white men marry or partner with black women. This article asks if such gender asymmetries relate to the racial character of the neighborhoods in which households headed by mixed-race couples live. Gendered power imbalances within households generally play into decisions about where to live or where to move (i.e., men typically benefit more than women), and we find the same in mixed-race couple arrangements and residential attainment. Gender interacts with race to produce a measurable race-by-gender effect. Specifically, we report a positive relationship between the percentage white in a neighborhood and the presence of households headed by mixed-race couples with a white male partner. The opposite holds for households headed by white-blacks and white-Latinos if the female partner is white; they are drawn to predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods. The results have implications for investigations of residential location attainment, neighborhood segregation analysis, and mixed-race studies. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aFemale  a Gender  a Marriage  a Race  a Racial  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g2h393-420tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360657&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201303031naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450152002311000019003831100013004025201490004156500038019056500076019436500066020196500109020856510023021946530010022176530011022276530012022386530013022506530012022636530013022756530015022886530013023036530014023166550020023307730030023508560006023808560196023869030015025821360658  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212919  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0161-5  aI12  aJ13  aJ16  aO1510aWhy Is Infant Mortality Higher in Boys Than in Girls? A New Hypothesis Based on Preconception Environment and Evidence from a Large Sample of Twins10aPongou, Roland  aU Ottawa  aInfant mortality is higher in boys than girls in most parts of the world. This has been explained by sex differences in genetic and biological makeup, with boys being biologically weaker and more susceptible to diseases and premature death. At the same time, recent studies have found that numerous preconception or prenatal environmental factors affect the probability of a baby being conceived male or female. I propose that these environmental factors also explain sex differences in mortality. I contribute a new methodology of distinguishing between child biology and preconception environment by comparing male-female differences in mortality across opposite-sex twins, same-sex twins, and all twins. Using a large sample of twins from sub-Saharan Africa, I find that both preconception environment and child biology increase the mortality of male infants, but the effect of biology is substantially smaller than the literature suggests. I also estimate the interacting effects of biology with some intrauterine and external environmental factors, including birth order within a twin pair, social status, and climate. I find that a twin is more likely to be male if he is the firstborn, born to an educated mother, or born in certain climatic conditions. Male firstborns are more likely to survive than female firstborns, but only during the neonatal period. Finally, mortality is not affected by the interactions between biology and climate or between biology and social status. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSub-Saharan Africa  aBirth  a Child  a Deaths  a Disease  a Female  a Infants  a Mortality  a Mothers  a Prenatal  aJournal Article  g50g2h421-44tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360658&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201301368naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450161002311000019003921100013004116500038004246500076004626500066005386500109006046510023007136530012007366530015007486550020007637730030007838560006008138560196008199030015010151360659  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212926  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0183-z  aI12  aJ13  aJ16  aO1510aWhy Is Infant Mortality Higher in Boys Than in Girls?

We exploit a unique feature of schooling in Seoul--the random assignment of students into single-sex versus coeducational high schools--to assess causal effects of single-sex schools on college entrance exam scores and college attendance. Our validation of the random assignment shows comparable socioeconomic backgrounds and prior academic achievement of students attending single-sex schools and coeducational schools, which increases the credibility of our causal estimates of single-sex school effects. The three-level hierarchical model shows that attending all-boys schools or all-girls schools, rather than coeducational schools, is significantly associated with higher average scores on Korean and English test scores. Applying the school district fixed-effects models, we find that single-sex schools produce a higher percentage of graduates who attended four-year colleges and a lower percentage of graduates who attended two-year junior colleges than do coeducational schools. The positive effects of single-sex schools remain substantial, even after we take into account various school-level variables, such as teacher quality, the student-teacher ratio, the proportion of students receiving lunch support, and whether the schools are public or private. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aHigher Education; Research Institutions         b(I23) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aS.

We show that our gender-specific crosswalk more accurately captures the trends in occupational segregation that are masked using the aggregate crosswalk (based on combined male and female employment) provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. Using the 2000 occupational codes, we find that segregation by sex declined substantially over the period but at a diminished pace over the decades, falling by only 1.1 percentage points (on a decadal basis) in the 2000s. A primary mechanism by which segregation was reduced was through the entry of new cohorts of women, presumably better prepared than their predecessors and/or encountering less labor market discrimination; during the 1970s and 1980s, however, occupational segregation also decreased within cohorts. Reductions in segregation were correlated with education, with the largest decrease among college graduates and very little change in segregation among high school dropouts. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71) 4aLabor Standards: Working Conditions         b(J81)  aU.S.  aDiscrimination  a Education  a Female  a Gender  a Segregation  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g2h471-92tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360661&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201301445naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450139002311000022003707000020003927000025004121100014004377100009004517100049004606500066005096500083005756500041006586500056006996510009007556530011007646530017007756550020007927730030008128560006008428560196008489030015010441360662  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212918  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0198-0  aJ16  aJ24  aJ71  aJ8110aTrends in Occupational Segregation by Gender 1970-2009: Adjusting for the Impact of Changes in the Occupational Coding System: Erratum10aBlau, Francine D.10aBrummund, Peter10aLiu, Albert Yung-Hsu  aCornell U  aU AL  aMathematica Policy Research Inc, Oakland, CA 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71) 4aLabor Standards: Working Conditions         b(J81)  aU.S.  aGender  a Segregation  aJournal Article  g50g2h493-94tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360662&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201302333naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450112002231000022003351100009003575200981003666500038013476500076013856500113014616510009015746530010015836530012015936530013016056530015016186530021016336530013016546530012016676550020016797730031016998560006017308560196017369030015019321360663  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212923  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0152-6  aI12  aJ13  aJ1510aParadox Revisited: A Further Investigation of Racial/Ethnic Differences in Infant Mortality by Maternal Age10aPowers, Daniel A.  aU TX  aI reexamine the epidemiological paradox of lower overall infant mortality rates in the Mexican-origin population relative to U.S.-born non-Hispanic whites using the 1995-2002 U.S. NCHS linked cohort birth-infant death files. A comparison of infant mortality rates among U.S.-born non-Hispanic white and Mexican-origin mothers by maternal age reveals an infant survival advantage at younger maternal ages when compared with non-Hispanic whites, which is consistent with the Hispanic infant mortality paradox. However, this is accompanied by higher infant mortality at older ages for Mexican-origin women, which is consistent with the weathering framework. These patterns vary by nativity of the mother and do not change when rates are adjusted for risk factors. The relative infant survival disadvantage among Mexican-origin infants born to older mothers may be attributed to differences in the socioeconomic attributes of U.S.-born non-Hispanic white and Mexican-origin women. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Deaths  a Infants  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  a Mothers  a Racial  aJournal Article  g50g2h495-520tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360663&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201301799naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001992450088002071000021002957000021003161100044003377100015003815200806003966500038012026530014012406550020012547730030012748560006013048560196013109030015015061360664  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212909  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0160-6  aI1210aEstimation of Covariate Effects with Current Status Data and Differential Mortality10aPalloni, Alberto10aThomas, Jason R.  aCenter for Demography and Ecology, U WI  aPA State U  aThe assessment of the impact that socioeconomic determinants have on the prevalence of certain chronic conditions reported by respondents in population surveys must confront two problems. First, the self-reports could be in error (false positives and false negatives). Second, those reporting are a selected sample of those who ever experience the problem, and this selection is heavily influenced by excess mortality attributable to the condition being reported. In this article, we use a combination of empirical data and microsimulation to (a) assess the magnitude of the bias attributable to the selection problem, and (b) suggest an adjustment procedure that corrects for this bias. We find that the proposed adjustment procedure considerably reduces the bias arising from differential mortality. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aMortality  aJournal Article  g50g2h521-44tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360664&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201302485naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450077002231000019003007000017003191100036003367100036003725201132004086500038015406500113015786500066016916510009017576530011017666530012017776530015017896530015018046530013018196550020018327730030018528560006018828560196018889030015020841360665  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212916  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0159-z  aI12  aJ15  aJ1613aThe Contribution of Smoking to Black-White Differences in U.S. Mortality10aHo, Jessica Y.10aElo, Irma T.  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aSmoking has significantly impacted American mortality and remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. No previous study has systematically examined the contribution of smoking-attributable deaths to mortality trends among blacks or to black-white mortality differences at older ages over time in the United States. In this article, we employ multiple methods and data sources to provide a comprehensive assessment of this contribution. We find that smoking has contributed to the black-white gap in life expectancy at age 50 for males, accounting for 20% to 48% of the gap between 1980 and 2005, but not for females. The fraction of deaths attributable to smoking at ages above 50 is greater for black males than for white males; and among men, current smoking status explains about 20% of the black excess relative risk in all-cause mortality at ages above 50 without adjustment for socioeconomic characteristics. These findings advance our understanding of the contribution of smoking to contemporary mortality trends and differences and reinforce the need for interventions that better address the needs of all groups. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Female  a Morbidity  a Mortality  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g50g2h545-68tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360665&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201302067naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450112002151000019003271100015003465200891003616500059012526500038013116510009013496530013013586530012013716530015013836530021013986530016014196530015014356550020014507730030014708560006015008560196015069030015017021360666  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212924  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0164-2  aC53  aI1213aThe Predictive Validity of Subjective Mortality Expectations: Evidence from the Health and Retirement Study10aElder, Todd E.  aMI State U  aSeveral recent studies suggest that individual subjective survival forecasts are powerful predictors of both mortality and behavior. Using 15 years of longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study, I present an alternative view. Across a wide range of ages, predictions of in-sample mortality rates based on subjective forecasts are substantially less accurate than predictions based on population life tables. Subjective forecasts also fail to capture fundamental properties of senescence, including increases in yearly mortality rates with age. To shed light on the mechanisms underlying these biases, I develop and estimate a latent-factor model of how individuals form subjective forecasts. The estimates of this model's parameters imply that these forecasts incorporate several important sources of measurement error that arguably swamp the useful information they convey. 4aForecasting Models; Simulation Methods         b(C53) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aForecast  a Health  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  a Prediction  a Predictor  aJournal Article  g50g2h569-89tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360666&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201302394naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450105002151000023003201100014003435201223003576500038015806500172016186510009017906530012017996530013018116550020018247730031018448560006018758560196018819030015020771360667  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212915  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0176-y  aI12  aR2310aFactors Associated with Temporal and Spatial Patterns in Suicide Rates across U.S. States, 1976-200010aPhillips, Julie A.  aRutgers U  aUsing pooled cross-sectional time-series data for the 50 U.S. states over a 25-year period, this article examines how well four conceptual groups of social correlates--demographic, economic, social, and cultural factors--are associated with the 1976-2000 patterns in overall suicide rates and suicide by firearms and other means. Unlike past research that typically considers only one dimension, this analysis differentiates between spatial and temporal variation in suicide rates to determine whether and how social correlates operate differently in these two contexts. Results indicate that suicide rates correspond closely to social correlates. Within U.S. states, lower overall suicide rates between 1976 and 2000 were associated with demographic change (e.g., larger numbers of foreign-born) as well as with fewer numbers of Episcopalians. Across U.S. states, variation in overall suicide rates over the period was related to demographic (percentage male), economic (per capita income), social (percentage divorced), and cultural (alcohol consumption and gun ownership) factors. However, findings differ importantly by type of suicide, and across time and space. Reasons for these distinct patterns are discussed. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aSpatial  a Suicide  aJournal Article  g50g2h591-614tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360667&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201302926naa  2200469   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450080002311000021003117000013003327000018003457000019003631100019003827100019004017100019004207100019004395201400004586500038018586500065018966500076019616500066020376510009021036530010021126530012021226530015021346530013021496530015021626530012021776550020021897730030022098560006022398560196022459030015024411360668  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212910  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0148-2  aI12  aI20  aJ13  aJ1610aMaternal Education, Birth Weight, and Infant Mortality in the United States10aGage, Timothy B.10aFang, Fu10aO'Neill, Erin10aDiRienzo, Greg  aU Albany, SUNY  aU Albany, SUNY  aU Albany, SUNY  aU Albany, SUNY  aThis research determines whether the observed decline in infant mortality with socioeconomic level, operationalized as maternal education (dichotomized as college or more, versus high school or less), is due to its "indirect" effect (operating through birth weight) and/or to its "direct" effect (independent of birth weight). The data used are the 2001 U.S. national African American, Mexican American, and European American birth cohorts by sex. The analysis explores the birth outcomes of infants undergoing normal and compromised fetal development separately by using covariate density defined mixture of logistic regressions (CDDmlr). Among normal births, mean birth weight increases significantly (by 27-108 g) with higher maternal education. Mortality declines significantly (by a factor of 0.40-0.96) through the direct effect of education. The indirect effect of education among normal births is small but significant in three cohorts. Furthermore, the indirect effect of maternal education tends to increase mortality despite improved birth weight. Among compromised births, education has small and inconsistent effects on birth weight and infant mortality. Overall, our results are consistent with the view that the decrease in infant death by socioeconomic level is not mediated by improved birth weight. Interventions targeting birth weight may not result in lower infant mortality. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Deaths  a Education  a Infants  a Mortality  a School  aJournal Article  g50g2h615-35tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360668&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201302722naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450096002311000022003271100022003495201309003716500038016806500065017186500084017836500076018676510011019436530010019546530014019646530015019786530012019936530015020056530013020206530012020336550020020457730030020658560006020958560196021019030015022971360669  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212912  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0155-3  aI12  aI20  aJ12  aJ1310aFrom Child to Parent? The Significance of Children's Education for Their Parents' Longevity10aTorssander, Jenny  aSOFI, Stockholm U  aIn addition to own education and other socioeconomic resources, the education of one's children may be important for individual health and longevity. Mothers and fathers born between 1932 and 1941 were analyzed by linking them to their children in the Swedish Multi-generation Register, which covers the total population. Controlling for parents' education, social class, and income attenuates but does not remove the association between children's education and parents' mortality risk. Shared but unmeasured familial background characteristics were addressed by comparing siblings in the parental generation. In these fixed-effects analyses, comparing parents whose children had tertiary education with parents whose children completed only compulsory schooling (the reference group) yields a hazard ratio of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70-0.89) when the socioeconomic position of both parents is controlled for. The relationship is certainly not purely causal, but part of it could be if, for example, well-educated adult children use their resources to find the best available health care for their aging parents. I therefore introduce the concept of "social foreground" and suggest that children's socioeconomic resources may be an important factor in trying to further understand social inequalities in health. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aSweden  aChild  a Children  a Education  a Health  a Mortality  a Mothers  a Parent  aJournal Article  g50g2h637-59tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360669&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201301713naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001992450104002071000023003111100040003345200701003746500108010756510009011836550020011927730030012128560006012428560196012489030015014441360670  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212925  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0167-z  aJ1410aTrends in Late-Life Activity Limitations in the United States: An Update from Five National Surveys10aFreedman, Vicki A.  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aThis article updates trends from five national U.S. surveys to determine whether the prevalence of activity limitations among the older population continued to decline in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Findings across studies suggest that personal care and domestic activity limitations may have continued to decline for those ages 85 and older from 2000 to 2008, but generally were flat since 2000 for those ages 65-84. Modest increases were observed for the 55- to 64-year-old group approaching late life, although prevalence remained low for this age group. Inclusion of the institutional population is important for assessing trends among those ages 85 and older in particular. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g50g2h661-71tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360670&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201302938naa  2200481   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450086002231000021003097000019003307000024003497000025003737000027003981100037004257100014004627100037004767100037005137100067005505201283006176500059019006500038019596500073019976510016020706530015020866530014021016530017021156530012021326530014021446530015021586530016021736550020021897730030022098560006022398560196022459030015024411360671  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212922  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0156-2  aC53  aI12  aI1810aModeling and Forecasting Health Expectancy: Theoretical Framework and Application10aMajer, Istvan M.10aStevens, Ralph10aNusselder, Wilma J.10aMackenbach, Johan P.10avan Baal, Pieter H.

Therefore, complementing forecasts of life expectancy with forecasts of health expectancies is useful. To forecast health expectancy, an extension of the stochastic extrapolative models developed for forecasting total life expectancy could be applied, but instead of projecting total mortality and using regular life tables, one could project transition probabilities between health states simultaneously and use multistate life table methods. In this article, we present a theoretical framework for a multistate life table model in which the transition probabilities depend on age and calendar time. The goal of our study is to describe a model that projects transition probabilities by the Lee-Carter method, and to illustrate how it can be used to forecast future health expectancy with prediction intervals around the estimates. We applied the method to data on the Dutch population aged 55 and older, and projected transition probabilities until 2030 to obtain forecasts of life expectancy, disability-free life expectancy, and probability of compression of disability. 4aForecasting Models; Simulation Methods         b(C53) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18)  aNetherlands  aDisability  a Forecast  a Forecasting  a Health  a Modeling  a Mortality  a Prediction  aJournal Article  g50g2h673-97tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360671&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S66WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201303019naa  2200493   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450057002311000027002887000022003157000021003377000017003581100012003757100012003877100014003997100020004135201352004336500081017856500084018666500076019506500109020266510010021356530010021456530018021556530014021736530015021876530012022026530015022146530014022296530012022436550020022557730031022758560006023068560198023129030015025101360672  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212913  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0147-3  aD91  aJ12  aJ13  aO1510aReturns on Lifetime Investments in Children in Egypt10aCunningham, Solveig A.10aYount, Kathryn M.10aEngelman, Michal10aAgree, Emily  aEmory U  aEmory U  aU Chicago  aJohns Hopkins U  aParental expectations about the companionship and assistance they will receive in later life from their children are key considerations in family formation decisions. We explore patterns of parents' investment and the support and contact they receive from adult children in Egypt, where fertility is falling and sources of support at all life stages are in flux. Using data from a survey of older adults in Ismailia governorate, we consider parents' past investments in childbearing, child survival, and children's education and marriage, as well as recent assistance to adult children via housing, care for grandchildren, gifts, and money. The returns from children considered include economic assistance, instrumental support, and visits. Most parental investments are associated with frequent visits from children. The assistance children provide to parents is gendered: sons tend to provide economic transfers, whereas daughters tend to provide instrumental help. A greater number of surviving children is most strongly associated with parents' receipt of multiple types of later-life returns. Investments in children's education and marriage are not associated with assistance, but recent assistance to children--especially economic transfers and provision of housing--is associated with receiving instrumental assistance from adult children. 4aIntertemporal Household Choice; Life Cycle Models and Saving         b(D91) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aEgypt  aChild  a Childbearing  a Children  a Education  a Family  a Fertility  a Marriage  a Parent  aJournal Article  g50g2h699-724tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360672&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201302483naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450080002311000024003111100016003355201131003516500048014826500084015306500076016146500109016906510010017996530011018096530016018206530016018366550020018527730030018728560006019028560198019089030015021061360673  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212914  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0150-8  aI31  aJ12  aJ13  aO1510aFamily Instability and Early Initiation of Sexual Activity in Western Kenya10aGoldberg, Rachel E.  aPrinceton U  aEpidemiological, economic, and social forces have produced high levels of volatility in family and household structure for young people growing up in sub-Saharan Africa in recent decades. However, scholarship on the family to date has not examined the influence of this family instability on young people's well-being. The current study employs unique life history calendar data from Western Kenya to investigate the relationship between instability in caregiving and early initiation of sexual activity. It draws on a body of work on parental union instability in the United States, and examines new dimensions of family change. Analyses reveal a positive association between transitions in primary caregiver and the likelihood of early sexual debut that is rapidly manifested following caregiver change and persists for a short period. The association is strongest at early ages, and there is a cumulative effect of multiple caregiver changes. The results highlight the importance of studying family stability in sub-Saharan Africa, as distinct from family structure, and for attention to dimensions such as age and recency. 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aKenya  aFamily  a Well Being  a Well-being  aJournal Article  g50g2h725-50tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360673&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201303167naa  2200493   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002310430008002392450094002471000023003417000021003641100037003857100037004225201392004596500044018516500066018956500053019616500065020146500065020796500109021446510011022536530025022646530017022896530012023066530029023186530019023476530013023666530015023796530010023946550020024047730030024248560006024548560198024609030015026581360674  a201304       201304                        eng     aEP86212917  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0153-5  aF22  aJ16  aJ22  aJ31  aJ61  aO1510aHow Job Characteristics Affect International Migration: The Role of Informality in Mexico10aVillarreal, Andres10aBlanchard, Sarah  aPopulation Research Center, U TX  aPopulation Research Center, U TX  aDespite the importance given to employment opportunities as a primary motive for migration, previous studies have paid insufficient attention to the kinds of jobs that are more likely to retain workers in their countries of origin. We use information from a panel survey of Mexican adults to examine how job characteristics affect the risk of international migration. The sampling strategy and overall size of the survey allow us to analyze the effect of employment characteristics on migration from urban areas, which have much greater labor market diversity, and to separate our analysis by gender. We also distinguish migrants according to whether they migrate for work or for other reasons. We find informality to be a significant predictor of international migration. Even after controlling for individual factors including workers' wages, as well as various household- and community-level predictors, we find that workers employed in the informal sector have significantly higher odds of migrating than their counterparts in the formal sector. The pervasive nature of informality in many developing countries from which a high proportion of international migrants originate may therefore create a constant supply of workers who are predisposed to migrate. Our findings thus have important implications for a proper understanding of the effects of economic development on migration. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMexico  aDeveloping Countries  a Development  a Gender  a International Migration  a Labor Markets  a Migrant  a Migration  a Wage  aJournal Article  g50g2h751-75tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1360674&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aApril 201302443naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450079002151000021002947000023003151100085003387100009004235201248004326500055016806500076017356510009018116530013018206530014018336550020018477730028018678560006018958560198019019030018020991349890  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88151999  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0146-4  aD14  aJ1310aInvesting in Children: Changes in Parental Spending on Children, 1972-200710aKornrich, Sabino10aFurstenberg, Frank  aCenter for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences, Juan March Institute, Madrid  aU PA  aParental spending on children is often presumed to be one of the main ways that parents invest in children and a main reason why children from wealthier households are advantaged. Yet, although research has tracked changes in the other main form of parental investment--namely, time--there is little research on spending. We use data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey to examine how spending changed from the early 1970s to the late 2000s, focusing particularly on inequality in parental investment in children. Parental spending increased, as did inequality of investment. We also investigate shifts in the composition of spending and linkages to children's characteristics. Investment in male and female children changed substantially: households with only female children spent significantly less than parents in households with only male children in the early 1970s; but by the 1990s, spending had equalized; and by the late 2000s, girls appeared to enjoy an advantage. Finally, the shape of parental investment over the course of children's lives changed. Prior to the 1990s, parents spent most on children in their teen years. After the 1990s, however, spending was greatest when children were under the age of 6 and in their mid-20s. 4aHousehold Saving; Personal Finance         b(D14) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Consumer  aJournal Article  g50g1h1-23tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349890&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201302535naa  2200493   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450079002311000015003107000017003257000022003427000020003641100015003847100008003997100009004077100015004165200946004316500059013776500084014366500076015206500053015966510009016496530014016586530014016726530017016866530014017036530012017176530016017296530013017456530012017586550020017707730029017908560006018198560198018259030018020231349891  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88152000  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0138-4  aD12  aJ12  aJ13  aJ2210aTime for Children: Trends in the Employment Patterns of Parents, 1967-200910aFox, Liana10aHan, Wen-Jui10aRuhm, Christopher10aWaldfogel, Jane  aColumbia U  aNYU  aU VA  aColumbia U  aUsing data from the 1967-2009 years of the March Current Population Surveys (CPS), we examine two important resources for children's well-being: time and money. We document trends in parental employment, from the perspective of children, and show what underlies these trends. We find that increases in family work hours mainly reflect movements into jobs by parents--particularly mothers, who in prior decades would have remained at home. This increase in market work has raised incomes for children in the typical two-parent family but not for those in lone-parent households. Time use data from 1975 and 2003-2008 reveal that working parents spend less time engaged in primary childcare than their counterparts without jobs but more than employed peers in previous cohorts. Analysis of 2004 work schedule data suggests that non-daytime work provides an alternative method of coordinating employment schedules for some dual-earner families. 4aConsumer Economics: Empirical Analysis         b(D12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22)  aU.S.  aChildcare  a Children  a Dual Earner  a Families  a Family  a Households  a Mothers  a Parent  aJournal Article  g50g1h25-49tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349891&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201302165naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450040002151000025002557000016002807000025002961100014003217100014003357100014003495200983003636500055013466500084014016510009014856530012014946530014015066530012015206550020015327730029015528560006015818560198015879030018017851349892  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88152001  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0144-6  aD14  aJ1210aMarital Sorting and Parental Wealth10aCharles, Kerwin Kofi10aHurst, Erik10aKillewald, Alexandra  aU Chicago  aU Chicago  aHarvard U  aThe extent of marital sorting by socioeconomic background has implications for the intergenerational transmission of inequality, the role of marriage as a mechanism for social mobility, and the extent of cross-group interactions within a society. However, studies of assortative mating have disproportionately focused on spouses' education, rather than their social origins. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), and exploiting the unique genealogical design of the data set, we study the degree to which spouses sort on the basis of parental wealth. We find that the estimated correlation in parental wealth among married spouses, after controlling for race and age, is about .4. Importantly, we show that controlling for spousal education explains only one-quarter of sorting based on parental wealth. We show that our results are robust to accounting for measurement error in spousal reports of parental wealth and for selection into and out of marriage. 4aHousehold Saving; Personal Finance         b(D14) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aMarital  a Marriage  a Spouse  aJournal Article  g50g1h51-70tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349892&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201303162naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002310430008002392450067002471000019003141100069003335201290004026500077016926500113017696500065018826500109019476500119020566500172021756510017023476530014023646530015023786530014023936530016024076530011024236530011024346550020024457730029024658560006024948560198025009030018026981349893  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88152002  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0140-x  aJ11  aJ15  aJ61  aO15  aO18  aR2310aMoving across Boundaries: Migration in South Africa, 1950-200010aReed, Holly E.  aQueens College, CUNY and CUNY Institute for Demographic Research  aExisting knowledge about historical patterns of black internal migration in South Africa is incomplete, primarily because of the lack of good life course studies as well as the apartheid government's suppression and censoring of data. This article provides a comprehensive picture of historical internal migration patterns with an analysis of a unique individual retrospective life history data set. This sample of the black population, collected in 2000, is the only known nationally representative life history data for South Africa; it includes all residential moves for each individual during his/her lifetime. Various mobility outcomes are analyzed: moves within/across provinces, moves within/across rural and urban areas, forced moves, moves with a nuclear family, and individual moves. The results indicate that migration significantly increased among black South Africans during the last half of the twentieth century, and that this increase began before the Pass Laws were repealed in 1986 and well before the official end of apartheid in 1991 or the first free election in 1994. The timing of this increase in migration rates suggests that migration in defiance of the Pass Laws (albeit a dangerous and desperate proposition) was a way of life for many black South Africans. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aSouth Africa  aApartheid  a Migration  a Mobility  a Population  a Rural  a Urban  aJournal Article  g50g1h71-95tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349893&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201303099naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450108002231000018003317000019003497000027003681100015003957100015004107100017004255201523004426500077019656500113020426500172021556510009023276530011023366530015023476530016023626530014023786530025023926550020024177730030024378560006024678560198024739030018026711349894  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88152003  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0136-6  aJ11  aJ15  aR2310aSun Belt Rising: Regional Population Change and the Decline in Black Residential Segregation, 1970-200910aIceland, John10aSharp, Gregory10aTimberlake, Jeffrey M.  aPA State U  aPA State U  aU Cincinnati  aThe goal of this study is to examine the extent to which population shifts over the post-Great Migration period and divergent trends in segregation across regions contributed to the overall decline in black segregation in the United States in recent decades. Using data from the 1970 to 2000 decennial censuses and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS), our analysis indicates that black dissimilarity and isolation declined more in the South and West than in the Northeast and Midwest. Nevertheless, regional population shifts account for only a modest amount (8% to 12%) of the decline in black-white segregation over the period and for an even smaller proportion of the decline in black-nonblack segregation, in part because the largest declines in segregation occurred in the West while the region with the largest relative increase in the black population was the South. Using more refined census divisions rather than census regions provided some additional explanatory power (shifts across divisions explained 15%-16% of the decline in black-white segregation): divisions with larger gains in their share of the black population tended to have larger declines in black segregation. Overall, although the effect of the regional redistribution of the black population on declines in segregation was significant, of even greater importance were other causes of substantial declines in segregation in a wide array of metropolitan areas across the country, and especially in the West, over the past 40 years. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Migration  a Population  a Regional  a Regional Population  aJournal Article  g50g1h97-123tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349894&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201302193naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450076002231000018002997000022003171100009003397100017003485200757003656500077011226500103011996500172013026530010014746530012014846530018014966530017015146530016015316550020015477730030015678560006015978560198016039030018018011349895  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88152004  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0137-5  aJ11  aR11  aR2310aPopulation Trends as a Counterweight to Central City Decline, 1950-200010aBoustan, Leah10aShertzer, Allison  aUCLA  aU Pittsburgh  aThe share of metropolitan residents living in central cities declined dramatically from 1950 to 2000. We argue that cities would have lost even further ground if not for demographic trends such as renewed immigration, delayed childbearing, and a decline in the share of households headed by veterans. We provide causal estimates of the effect of children on residential location using the birth of twins. The effect of veteran status is identified from a discontinuity in the probability of military service during and after the mass mobilization for World War II. Our results suggest that these changes in demographic composition were strong enough to bolster city population but not to fully counteract socioeconomic factors favoring suburban growth. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aRegional Economic Activity: Growth, Development, Environmental Issues, and Changes         b(R11) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aBirth  a Cities  a Demographics  a Immigration  a Population  aJournal Article  g50g1h125-47tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349895&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201303084naa  2200553   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002310430008002390430008002472450123002551000019003787000021003971100017004187100011004355200988004466500038014346500084014726500076015566500066016326500109016986500119018076500172019266510015020986530010021136530011021236530014021346530012021486530021021606530015021816530012021966530015022086530011022236530013022346530011022476550020022587730030022788560006023088560198023149030018025121349896  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88152005  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0172-2  aI12  aJ12  aJ13  aJ16  aO15  aO18  aR2310aFamily Planning and Women's and Children's Health: Long-Term Consequences of an Outreach Program in Matlab, Bangladesh10aJoshi, Shareen10aSchultz, T. Paul  aGeorgetown U  aYale U  aWe analyze the impact of an experimental maternal and child health and family planning program that was established in Matlab, Bangladesh, in 1977. Village data from 1974, 1982, and 1996 suggest that program villages experienced a decline in fertility of about 17 %. Household data from 1996 confirm that this decline in "surviving fertility" persisted for nearly two decades. Women in program villages also experienced other benefits: increased birth spacing, lower child mortality, improved health status, and greater use of preventive health inputs. Some benefits also diffused beyond the boundaries of the program villages into neighboring comparison villages. These effects are robust to the inclusion of individual, household, and community characteristics. We conclude that the benefits of this reproductive and child health program in rural Bangladesh have many dimensions extending well beyond fertility reduction, which do not appear to dissipate rapidly after two decades. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aBangladesh  aBirth  a Child  a Children  a Family  a Family Planning  a Fertility  a Health  a Mortality  a Rural  a Village  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g1h149-80tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349896&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201302427naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450112002311000023003437000023003667000021003891100028004107100016004387100039004545200920004936500038014136500084014516500066015356500065016016510016016666530012016826530015016946530012017096530011017216550020017327730031017528560006017838560198017899030018019871349897  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88152006  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0139-3  aI12  aJ12  aJ16  aJ3113aThe Association between Individual Income and Remaining Life Expectancy at the Age of 65 in the Netherlands10aKalwij, Adriaan S.10aAlessie, Rob J.

For this purpose, we estimate a mortality risk model using a large administrative data set that covers the 1996-2007 period. Besides age and marital status, the model includes as covariates individual and spouse's income as well as a random individual specific effect. It thus allows for dynamic selection based on both observed and unobserved characteristics. We find that conditional on marital status, individual income is about equally strong and negatively associated with mortality risk for men and women and that spouse's income is only weakly associated with mortality risk for women. For both men and women, we quantify remaining life expectancy at age 65 for low-income individuals as approximately 2.5 years less than that for high-income individuals. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31)  aNetherlands  aMarital  a Mortality  a Spouse  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g1h181-206tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349897&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201302580naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450082002231000022003051100042003275201222003696500038015916500084016296500109017136510023018226530011018456530018018566530016018746530017018906530012019076530015019196550020019347730030019548560006019848560198019909030018021881349898  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88152007  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0149-1  aI12  aJ12  aO1511aAdult Mortality from Sibling Survival Data: A Reappraisal of Selection Biases10aMasquelier, Bruno  aCatholic U Louvain and FNRS, Brussels  aBecause of incomplete registration of deaths in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, data on the survival of close relatives constitute the cornerstone of estimates of adult mortality. Since 1990, sibling histories have been widely collected in Demographic and Health Surveys and are increasingly being relied upon to estimate both general and maternal mortality. Until recently, the use of sibling histories was thought to lead to underestimates of mortality, but a more optimistic view in the literature emerged with the development by Gakidou and King (Demography 43:569-585, 2006) of corrections for selection biases. Based on microsimulations, this article shows that Gakidou and King's weighting scheme has been incorrectly applied to survey data, leading to overestimates of mortality, especially for males. The evidence for an association between mortality and sibship size in adulthood is reviewed. Female mortality appears to decline slightly with the number of surviving sisters, although this could be an artifact of severe recall errors in larger sibships or familial clustering of deaths. Under most circumstances, corrections for selection biases should have only a modest effect on sibling estimates. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSub-Saharan Africa  aDeaths  a Demographics  a Demography  a Development  a Health  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g50g1h207-28tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349898&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201303078naa  2200541   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450108002311000020003397000019003597000018003787000022003967000021004187000020004391100020004597100020004797100093004997100093005927100020006857100020007055201044007256500038017696500109018076500119019166500111020356510011021466530011021576530012021686530015021806530016021956530011022116530013022226530015022356530014022506550020022647730030022848560006023148560198023209030018025181349899  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88152008  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0135-7  aI12  aO15  aO18  aR4110aImpact of Road Traffic Deaths on Expected Years of Life Lost and Reduction in Life Expectancy in Brazil10aChandran, Aruna10aKahn, Geoffrey10aSousa, Tanara10aPechansky, Flavio10aBishai, David M.10aHyder, Adnan A.  aJohns Hopkins U  aJohns Hopkins U  aCenter for Drug and Alcohol Research, Federal U Rio Grande do Sul and HCPA, Porto Alegre  aCenter for Drug and Alcohol Research, Federal U Rio Grande do Sul and HCPA, Porto Alegre  aJohns Hopkins U  aJohns Hopkins U  aThe road traffic crash burden is significant in Brazil; calculating years of life lost and life expectancy reduction quantifies the burden of road traffic deaths to enable prioritization of this issue. Years of life lost and reduction in life expectancy were calculated using 2008 population/crash data from Brazil's ministries of health and transport. The potential for reduction in crash mortality was calculated for hypothetical scenarios reducing death rates to those of the best-performing region and age category. In Brazil, road traffic deaths reduce the at-birth life expectancy by 0.8 years for males and by 0.2 years for females. Many years of life lost for men and woman could be averted--270,733 and 123,986, respectively--if all rates matched those of the lowest-risk region and age category. This study further characterizes the burden of motor vehicle deaths in Brazil and quantifies the potential health benefits of policies/interventions that reduce road traffic death rates to those of the best-performing subpopulations. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aTransportation: Demand, Supply, and Congestion; Safety and Accidents; Transportation Noise         b(R41)  aBrazil  aDeaths  a Health  a Mortality  a Population  a Roads  a Traffic  a Transport  a Vehicles  aJournal Article  g50g1h229-36tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349899&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201302227naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450129002231000020003527000025003721100059003977100059004565200770005156500059012856500084013446500076014286530017015046530015015216530014015366530017015506530014015676550020015817730030016018560006016318560198016379030018018351349900  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88152009  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0154-4  aC53  aJ12  aJ1310aProbabilistic Forecasting Using Stochastic Diffusion Models, with Applications to Cohort Processes of Marriage and Fertility10aMyrskyla, Mikko10aGoldstein, Joshua R.  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock  aIn this article, we show how stochastic diffusion models can be used to forecast demographic cohort processes using the Hernes, Gompertz, and logistic models. Such models have been used deterministically in the past, but both behavioral theory and forecast utility are improved by introducing randomness and uncertainty into the standard differential equations governing population processes. Our approach is to add time-series stochasticity to linearized versions of each process. We derive both Monte Carlo and analytic methods for estimating forecast uncertainty. We apply our methods to several examples of marriage and fertility, extending them to simultaneous forecasting of multiple cohorts and to processes restricted by factors such as declining fecundity. 4aForecasting Models; Simulation Methods         b(C53) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aDemographics  a Fertility  a Forecast  a Forecasting  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g50g1h237-60tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349900&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201302168naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450096002151000020003117000019003317000019003501100013003697100069003827100013004515200873004646500059013376500038013966510022014346530013014566530017014696530015014866530021015016550020015227730030015428560006015728560198015789030018017761349901  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88152010  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0145-5  aC53  aI1210aCoherent Mortality Forecasting: The Product-Ratio Method with Functional Time Series Models10aHyndman, Rob J.10aBooth, Heather10aYasmeen, Farah  aMonash U  aDemographic and Social Research Institute, Australian National U  aMonash U  aWhen independence is assumed, forecasts of mortality for subpopulations are almost always divergent in the long term. We propose a method for coherent forecasting of mortality rates for two or more subpopulations, based on functional principal components models of simple and interpretable functions of rates. The product-ratio functional forecasting method models and forecasts the geometric mean of subpopulation rates and the ratio of subpopulation rates to product rates. Coherence is imposed by constraining the forecast ratio function through stationary time series models. The method is applied to sex-specific data for Sweden and state-specific data for Australia. Based on out-of-sample forecasts, the coherent forecasts are at least as accurate in overall terms as comparable independent forecasts, and forecast accuracy is homogenized across subpopulations. 4aForecasting Models; Simulation Methods         b(C53) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aAustralia; Sweden  aForecast  a Forecasting  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  aJournal Article  g50g1h261-83tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349901&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201302349naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450075002151000022002907000025003127000021003371100013003587100013003717100037003845200961004216500084013826500172014666510011016386530013016496530012016626530012016746530016016866550020017027730031017228560006017538560198017599030018019571349902  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88152011  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0142-8  aJ12  aR2310aYour Place or Mine?

We find that the labor market opportunities and family ties of both partners affect these location choices. Surprisingly, married men live significantly closer to their own parents than do married women, even if they have children, and this difference cannot be explained by differences in observed characteristics. The principal source of excess female distance from parents in this population is the relatively low mobility of men without a college degree, particularly in rural areas. Despite evidence that intergenerational resource flows, such as childcare and eldercare, are particularly important between women and their parents, the family connections of husbands appear to dominate the location decisions of less-educated married couples. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aNorway  aFamilies  a Family  a Parent  a Population  aJournal Article  g50g1h285-310tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349902&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201302290naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450073002311000021003041100021003255200808003466500048011546500065012026500160012676500172014276510010015996530021016096530016016306530010016466550020016567730030016768560006017068560198017129030018019101349903  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88152012  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0141-9  aI31  aJ31  aN33  aR2310aMalthusian Dynamics in a Diverging Europe: Northern Italy, 1650-188110aFernihough, Alan  aU College Dublin  aRecent empirical research questions the validity of using Malthusian theory in preindustrial England. Using real wage and vital rate data for the years 1650-1881, I provide empirical estimates for a different region: Northern Italy. The empirical methodology is theoretically underpinned by a simple Malthusian model, in which population, real wages, and vital rates are determined endogenously. My findings strongly support the existence of a Malthusian economy wherein population growth decreased living standards, which in turn influenced vital rates. However, these results also demonstrate how the system is best characterized as one of weak homeostasis. Furthermore, there is no evidence of Boserupian effects given that increases in population failed to spur any sustained technological progress. 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Europe: Pre-1913         b(N33) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aItaly  aLiving Standards  a Population  a Wage  aJournal Article  g50g1h311-32tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349903&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201303423naa  2200541   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002310430008002390430008002472450111002551000022003667000018003887000025004067000015004311100012004467100013004587100044004717100038005155201259005536500084018126500066018966500064019626500109020266500092021356500119022276500172023466510015025186530017025336530012025506530012025626530011025746530013025856530011025986550020026097730030026298560006026598560198026659030018028631349904  a201302       201302                        eng     aEP88152013  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0143-7  aJ12  aJ16  aK42  aO15  aO17  aO18  aR2311aA Survey Experiment of Women's Attitudes about Intimate Partner Violence against Women in Rural Bangladesh10aYount, Kathryn M.10aHalim, Nafisa10aSchuler, Sidney Ruth10aHead, Sara  aEmory U  aBoston U  aFamily Health International, Boston, MA  aICF International, Washington, DC  aAccording to the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in poorer countries, 50% of women of reproductive age report that wife hitting or beating is justified. Such high rates may result from structural pressures to adopt such views or to report the perceived socially desirable response. In a survey experiment of 496 ever-married women aged 18-49 years in rural Bangladesh, we compared responses to attitudinal questions that (1) replicated the 2007 Bangladesh DHS wording and portrayed the wife as transgressive for unstated reasons with elaborations depicting her as (2) unintentionally and (3) willfully transgressive. The probabilities of justifying wife hitting or beating were consistently low for unintended transgressions (.01-.08). Willful transgressions yielded higher probabilities (.40-.70), which resembled those based on the DHS wording (.38-.57). Cognitive interviews illustrated that village women held diverse views, which were attributed to social change. Also, ambiguity in the DHS questions may have led some women to interpret them according to perceived gender norms and to give the socially desirable response of justified. Results inform modifications to these DHS questions and identify women for ideational-change interventions. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aIllegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law         b(K42) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aFormal and Informal Sectors; Shadow Economy; Institutional Arrangements         b(O17) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aBangladesh  aDemographics  a Gender  a Health  a Rural  a Village  a Women  aJournal Article  g50g1h333-57tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1349904&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201302457naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450058002231000023002817000021003047000022003251100009003477100015003567100009003715201188003806500052015686500042016206500066016626510009017286530014017376530012017516530012017636530011017756550020017867730031018068560006018378560198018439030018020411338390  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330111  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0130-z  aI11  aI21  aJ1610aEducation and the Gender Gaps in Health and Mortality10aRoss, Catherine E.10aMasters, Ryan K.10aHummer, Robert A.  aU TX  aColumbia U  aU TX  aThe positive associations between education and health and survival are well established, but whether the strength of these associations depends on gender is not. Is the beneficial influence of education on survival and on self-rated health conditioned by gender in the same way, in opposite ways, or not at all? Because women are otherwise disadvantaged in socioeconomic resources that are inputs to health, their health and survival may depend more on education than will men's. To test this hypothesis, we use data from the National Health Interview Survey-Linked Mortality Files (NHIS-LMF). We find that education's beneficial influence on feeling healthy and on survival are conditional on gender, but in opposite ways. Education has a larger effect on women's self-rated health than on men's, but a larger effect on men's mortality. To further examine the mortality results, we examine specific causes of death. We find that the conditional effect is largest for deaths from lung cancer, respiratory disease, stroke, homicide, suicide, and accidents. Because women report worse health but men's mortality is higher, education closes the gender gap in both health and mortality. 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aEducation  a Gender  a Health  a Women  aJournal Article  g49g4h1157-83tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338390&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201202246naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450121002311000019003521100009003715200674003806500038010546500108010926500166012006500124013666510009014906530011014996530015015106530015015256530013015406530011015536530009015646550020015737730033015938560006016268560198016329030018018301338391  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330104  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0125-9  aI12  aJ14  aN31  aN4110aScarring and Mortality Selection among Civil War POWs: A Long-Term Mortality, Morbidity, and Socioeconomic Follow-Up10aCosta, Dora L.  aUCLA  aDebilitating events could leave either more frail or more robust survivors, depending on the extent of scarring and mortality selection. The majority of empirical analyses find more frail survivors. I find heterogeneous effects. Among severely stressed former Union Army prisoners of war (POWs), the effect that dominates 35 years after the end of the Civil War depends on age at imprisonment. Among survivors to 1900, those younger than 30 at imprisonment faced higher old-age mortality and morbidity and worse socioeconomic outcomes than non-POW and other POW controls, whereas those older than 30 at imprisonment faced a lower older-age death risk than the controls. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aEconomic History: Government, War, Law, International Relations, and Regulation: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N41)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Morbidity  a Mortality  a Old Age  a Union  a War  aJournal Article  g49g4h1185-1206tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338391&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201202022naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450103002151000017003187000021003351100020003567100015003765200873003916500038012646500077013026510017013796530011013966530016014076550020014237730031014438560006014748560198014809030018016781338392  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330103  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0133-9  aI12  aJ1111aA New Method for Determining Why Length of Life Is More Unequal in Some Populations Than in Others10aNau, Claudia10aFirebaugh, Glenn  aJohns Hopkins U  aPA State U  aWhy is there greater variability in individual longevity in some populations than in others? We propose a decomposition method designed to address that question by quantifying the effects of population differences in the spread, allocation, and timing of the principal causes of death. Applying the method to the United States and Sweden, we find that spread effects account for about two-thirds of the greater variance in age at death among American adults, meaning that two-thirds of the U.S.-Sweden difference would persist if the two countries differed only with respect to within-cause variance among adults. The remainder of the difference is due largely to allocation effects, with the greater incidence of homicides and fatal traffic accidents alone accounting for more than one-fourth of the greater variance in age at death among adults in the United States. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aSweden; U.S.  aDeaths  a Population  aJournal Article  g49g4h1207-30tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338392&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201202746naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450091002231000020003147000020003341100059003547100052004135201338004656500038018036500108018416500066019496510009020156530010020246530012020346530015020466530013020616530013020746550020020877730031021078560006021388560198021449030018023421338393  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330105  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0132-x  aI12  aJ14  aJ1610aMaternal Age and Offspring Adult Health: Evidence from the Health and Retirement Study10aMyrskyla, Mikko10aFenelon, Andrew  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock  aPopulation Studies and Training Center, Brown U  aAdvanced maternal age is associated with negative offspring health outcomes. This interpretation often relies on physiological processes related to aging, such as decreasing oocyte quality. We use a large, population-based sample of American adults to analyze how selection and lifespan overlap between generations influence the maternal age-offspring adult health association. We find that offspring born to mothers younger than age 25 or older than 35 have worse outcomes with respect to mortality, self-rated health, height, obesity, and the number of diagnosed conditions than those born to mothers aged 25-34. Controls for maternal education and age at which the child lost the mother eliminate the effect for advanced maternal age up to age 45. The association between young maternal age and negative offspring outcomes is robust to these controls. Our findings suggest that the advanced maternal age-offspring adult health association reflects selection and factors related to lifespan overlap. These may include shared frailty or parental investment but are not directly related to the physiological health of the mother during conception, fetal development, or birth. The results for young maternal age add to the evidence suggesting that children born to young mothers might be better off if the parents waited a few years. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aAging  a Health  a Mortality  a Mothers  a Obesity  aJournal Article  g49g4h1231-57tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338393&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201202636naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450142002151000027003571100088003845201415004726500038018876500073019256530012019986530012020106530015020226530012020376550020020497730031020698560006021008560198021069030018023041338394  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330101  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0122-z  aI12  aI1813aThe DYNAMO-HIA Model: An Efficient Implementation of a Risk Factor/Chronic Disease Markov Model for Use in Health Impact Assessment (HIA)10aBoshuizen, Hendriek C.  aNational Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven and Wageningen U  aIn Health Impact Assessment (HIA), or priority-setting for health policy, effects of risk factors (exposures) on health need to be modeled, such as with a Markov model, in which exposure influences mortality and disease incidence rates. Because many risk factors are related to a variety of chronic diseases, these Markov models potentially contain a large number of states (risk factor and disease combinations), providing a challenge both technically (keeping down execution time and memory use) and practically (estimating the model parameters and retaining transparency). To meet this challenge, we propose an approach that combines micro-simulation of the exposure information with macro-simulation of the diseases and survival. This approach allows users to simulate exposure in detail while avoiding the need for large simulated populations because of the relative rareness of chronic disease events. Further efficiency is gained by splitting the disease state space into smaller spaces, each of which contains a cluster of diseases that is independent of the other clusters. The challenge of feasible input data requirements is met by including parameter calculation routines, which use marginal population data to estimate the transitions between states. As an illustration, we present the recently developed model DYNAMO-HIA (DYNAMIC MODEL for Health Impact Assessment) that implements this approach. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18)  aDisease  a Health  a Mortality  a Policy  aJournal Article  g49g4h1259-83tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338394&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201202760naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450161002311000018003921100017004105201241004276500113016686500172017816500047019536500077020006530011020776530013020886530010021016530012021116550020021237730033021438560006021768560198021829030018023801338395  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330109  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0121-0  aJ15  aR23  aR31  aR3810aSegregation through the Lens of Housing Unit Transition: What Roles Do the Prior Residents, the Local Micro-neighborhood, and the Broader Neighborhood Play?10aHipp, John R.  aU CA, Irvine  aThis study focuses on segregation as it plays out at the micro-level of housing unit transition. Employing a unique sample that places housing units into micro-neighborhoods and census tracts, this study tests whether the characteristics of the previous residents of the unit, the local micro-neighborhood, or the broader tract best explain the race/ethnicity of the new residents in a housing unit. The results show that the racial/ethnic composition of the local micro-neighborhood has even stronger effects on the race/ethnicity of the new residents than does the racial/ethnic composition of the broader census tract. The results also reveal that even when the racial/ethnic composition of these two contexts are accounted for, the race/ethnicity of the prior residents has a very strong effect on the race/ethnicity of the new residents. I consider possible explanations for this household-level effect. One new theoretical explanation I put forward is that prospective residents use the race/ethnicity of the prior residents as a signal regarding the neighborhood's appropriateness for them; I test and find that this hypothesized signaling effect is even stronger in certain micro-neighborhood, neighborhood, and county contexts. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aHousing Supply and Markets         b(R31) 4aProduction Analysis and Firm Location: Government Policy         b(R38)  aCensus  a Housing  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g49g4h1285-1306tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338395&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201202291naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001992450068002071000018002757000017002937000018003101100009003287100009003377100018003465201193003646500077015576510015016346530028016496530015016776550020016927730031017128560006017438560198017499030018019471338396  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330116  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0117-9  aJ1110aMigration Systems in Europe: Evidence from Harmonized Flow Data10aDeWaard, Jack10aKim, Keuntae10aRaymer, James  aU WI  aU WI  aU Southampton  aEmpirical tests of migration systems theory require consistent and complete data on international migration flows. Publicly available data, however, represent an inconsistent and incomplete set of measurements obtained from a variety of national data collection systems. We overcome these obstacles by standardizing the available migration reports of sending and receiving countries in the European Union and Norway each year from 2003-2007 and by estimating the remaining missing flows. The resulting harmonized estimates are then used to test migration systems theory. First, locating thresholds in the size of flows over time, we identify three migration systems within the European Union and Norway. Second, examining the key determinants of flows with respect to the predictions of migration systems theory, our results highlight the importance of shared experiences of nation-state formation, geography, and accession status in the European Union. Our findings lend support to migration systems theory and demonstrate that knowledge of migration systems may improve the accuracy of migration forecasts toward managing the impacts of migration as a source of social change in Europe. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aEU; Norway  aInternational Migration  a Migration  aJournal Article  g49g4h1307-33tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338396&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201203208naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002310430008002392450132002471000017003791100014003965201420004106500069018306500032018996500065019316500109019966500119021056500172022246510011023966530015024076530013024226530015024356530010024506530017024606530012024776550020024897730031025098560006025408560198025469030018027441338397  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330107  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0128-6  aD31  aF24  aJ61  aO15  aO18  aR2310aRepeat Migration and Remittances as Mechanisms for Wealth Inequality in 119 Communities from the Mexican Migration Project Data10aGarip, Filiz  aHarvard U  aTo evaluate the distributional impact of remittances in origin communities, prior research studied how migrants' selectivity by wealth varies with migration prevalence in the community or prior migration experience of the individual. This study considers both patterns; it examines selectivity separately in low- and high-prevalence communities and for first-time and repeat migrants. Based on data from 18,042 household heads in 119 Mexican communities from the Mexican Migration Project, the analyses show that (1) first-time migrants in low-prevalence communities come from poor households, whereas repeat migrants in high-prevalence communities belong to wealthy households; and (2) higher amounts of remittances reach wealthy households. These results suggest that repeat migration and remittances may be mechanisms for wealth accumulation in the study communities. Descriptive analyses associate these mechanisms with increasing wealth disparities between households with and without migrants, especially in high-prevalence communities. The study, similar to prior findings, shows the importance of repeat migration trips, which, given sustained remittances, may amplify the wealth gap between migrants and nonmigrants in migrant-sending communities. The study also qualifies prior findings by differentiating between low- and high-prevalence communities and observing a growing wealth gap only in the latter. 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aRemittances         b(F24) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aMexico  aInequality  a Migrant  a Migration  a Poor  a Remittances  a Wealth  aJournal Article  g49g4h1335-60tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338397&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201202483naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450097002231000017003207000018003377000019003551100014003747100017003887100014004055201123004196500042015426500076015846500066016606510009017266530010017356530014017456530015017596530013017746530013017876550020018007730031018208560006018518560198018579030018020551338398  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330110  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0129-5  aI21  aJ13  aJ1610aDiverging Destinies: Maternal Education and the Developmental Gradient in Time with Children10aKalil, Ariel10aRyan, Rebecca10aCorey, Michael  aU Chicago  aGeorgetown U  aU Chicago  aUsing data from the 2003-2007 American Time Use Surveys (ATUS), we compare mothers' (N = 6,640) time spent in four parenting activities across maternal education and child age subgroups. We test the hypothesis that highly educated mothers not only spend more time in active child care than less-educated mothers but also alter the composition of that time to suit children's developmental needs more than less-educated mothers. Results support this hypothesis: not only do highly educated mothers invest more time in basic care and play when youngest children are infants or toddlers than when children are older, but differences across education groups in basic care and play time are largest among mothers with infants or toddlers; by contrast, highly educated mothers invest more time in management activities when children are 6 to 13 years old than when children are younger, and differences across education groups in management are largest among mothers with school-aged children. These patterns indicate that the education gradient in mothers' time with children is characterized by a "developmental gradient." 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Education  a Infants  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g49g4h1361-83tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338398&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201202100naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450073002311000014003041100025003185200802003436500038011456500065011836500076012486500066013246510009013906530010013996530014014096530015014236530013014386550020014517730033014718560006015048560198015109030018017081338399  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330113  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0123-y  aI12  aI20  aJ13  aJ1610aIs Biology Destiny?

The findings demonstrate that the direction and degree of differential treatment vary by mother's education. Less-educated mothers devote more total time and more educationally oriented time to heavier-birth-weight children, whereas better-educated mothers devote more total and more educationally oriented time to lower-birth-weight children. The compensating effects observed among highly educated mothers are substantially larger than the reinforcing effects among the least-educated mothers. The findings show that families redistribute resources in ways that both compensate for and exacerbate early-life disadvantages. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Children  a Education  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g49g4h1385-1405tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338399&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201201972naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450081002231000033003047000021003371100014003587100014003725200661003866500065010476500076011126500109011886510023012976530014013206530015013346550020013497730031013698560006014008560198014069030018016041338400  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330102  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0131-y  aI20  aJ13  aO1510aFertility Transitions and Schooling: From Micro- to Macro-level Associations20aEloundou-Enyegue, Parfait M.10aGiroux, Sarah C.  aCornell U  aCornell U  aResearch on the schooling implications of fertility transitions often faces an aggregation problem: despite policy interest in macro-level outcomes, empirical studies usually focus on the micro-level effects of sibsize on schooling.

These differences make it important to study race and education differences in contraceptive behavior. Using nationally representative data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth, this study examines the effects of race and education on the likelihood that women have ever used particular types of hormonal contraception and have ever discontinued hormonal contraception because of dissatisfaction. The results show that blacks and Latinas were more likely to have used injectable contraceptives ("the shot") and less likely to have used oral contraceptives ("the pill") than were white women. Women with less education were more likely than college-educated women to have used the shot but there were no significant education differences in use of the pill. Among women who had ever used hormonal birth control, those with less than a college degree were more likely than college-educated women to discontinue the birth control because of dissatisfaction. However, net of education, this study found no significant racial/ethnic differences in discontinuation. The most commonly stated reason for discontinuation because of dissatisfaction was side effects. 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Contraception  a Contraceptive  a Education  a Fertility  a Pregnancy  a Race  a Racial  a Women  aJournal Article  g49g4h1433-52tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338401&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201202957naa  2200457   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450135002311000026003667000026003921100009004187100009004275201316004366500065017526500084018176500076019016500109019776510011020866530015020976530011021126530014021236530018021376530015021556530014021706530012021846530015021966530015022116550020022267730031022468560006022778560198022839030018024811338402  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330115  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0118-8  aI20  aJ12  aJ13  aO1513aThe Changing Impact of Family Size on Adolescents' Schooling: Assessing the Exogenous Variation in Fertility Using Twins in Brazil10aMarteleto, Leticia J.10ade Souza, Laeticia R.  aU TX  aU WI  aResearchers have long been interested in the influence of family size on children's educational outcomes. Simply put, theories have suggested that resources are diluted within families that have more children. Although the empirical literature on developed countries has generally confirmed the theoretical prediction that family size is negatively related to children's education, studies focusing on developing societies have reported heterogeneity in this association. Recent studies addressing the endogeneity between family size and children's education have also cast doubt on the homogeneity of the negative role of family size on children's education. The goal of this study is to examine the causal effect of family size on children's education in Brazil over a 30-year period marked by important social and demographic change, and across extremely different regions within the country. We implement a twin birth instrumental variable approach to the nationally representative 1977-2009 PNAD data. Our results suggest an effect of family size on education that is not uniform throughout a period of significant social, economic, and demographic change. Rather, the causal effect of family size on adolescents' schooling resembles a gradient that ranges from positive to no effect, trending to negative. 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBrazil  aAdolescent  a Birth  a Children  a Demographics  a Education  a Families  a Family  a Fertility  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g49g4h1453-77tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338402&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201202550naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450138002151000020003537000024003731100028003977100028004255201296004536500056017496500084018056510009018896530017018986530012019156530012019276550020019397730031019598560006019908560198019969030018021941338403  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330114  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0126-8  aI32  aJ1210aMeasuring Cohabitation and Family Structure in the United States: Assessing the Impact of New Data from the Current Population Survey10aKennedy, Sheela10aFitch, Catherine A.  aPopulation Center, U MN  aPopulation Center, U MN  aIn 2007, the Current Population Survey (CPS) introduced a measure that identifies all cohabiting partners in a household, regardless of whether they describe themselves as "unmarried partners" in the relationship to householder question. The CPS now also links children to their biological, step-, and adoptive parents. Using these new variables, we analyze the prevalence of cohabitation as well as the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of different-sex cohabiting couples during the years 2007-2009. Estimates of cohabitation produced using only unmarried partnerships miss 18 % of all cohabiting unions and 12 % of children residing with cohabiting parents. Although differences between unmarried partners and most newly identified cohabitors are small, newly identified cohabitors are older, on average, and are less likely to be raising shared biological or adopted children. These new measures also allow us to identify a small number of young, disadvantaged couples who primarily reside in households of other family members, most commonly with parents. We conclude with an examination of the complex living arrangements and poverty status of American children, demonstrating the broader value of these new measures for research on American family and household structure. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Family  a Parent  aJournal Article  g49g4h1479-98tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338403&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201202594naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450113002311000028003447000024003721100009003967100009004055201114004146500053015286500116015816500068016976500078017656510009018436530016018526530012018686530018018806530023018986550020019217730033019418560006019748560198019809030018021781338404  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330108  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0124-x  aC83  aE24  aJ21  aJ6410aPanel Conditioning in Longitudinal Studies: Evidence from Labor Force Items in the Current Population Survey20aHalpern-Manners, Andrew10aWarren, John Robert  aU MN  aU MN  aDoes participating in a longitudinal survey affect respondents' answers to subsequent questions about their labor force characteristics? In this article, we investigate the magnitude of panel conditioning or time-in-survey biases for key labor force questions in the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS). Using linked CPS records for household heads first interviewed between January 2007 and June 2010, our analyses are based on strategic within-person comparisons across survey months and between-person comparisons across CPS rotation groups. We find considerable evidence for panel conditioning effects in the CPS. Panel conditioning downwardly biases the CPS-based unemployment rate, mainly by leading people to remove themselves from its denominator. Across surveys, CPS respondents (claim to) leave the labor force in greater numbers than otherwise equivalent respondents who are participating in the CPS for the first time. The results cannot be attributed to panel attrition or mode effects. We discuss implications for CPS-based research and policy as well as for survey methodology more broadly. 4aSurvey Methods; Sampling Methods         b(C83) 4aEmployment; Unemployment; Wages; Intergenerational Income Distribution; Aggregate Human Capital         b(E24) 4aLabor Force and Employment, Size, and Structure         b(J21) 4aUnemployment: Models, Duration, Incidence, and Job Search         b(J64)  aU.S.  aLabor Force  a Survey  a Unemployment  a Unemployment Rate  aJournal Article  g49g4h1499-1519tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338404&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201203526naa  2200553   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002310430008002392450099002471000026003467000023003727000022003957000023004177000022004401100037004627100036004997100009005357100036005447100036005805201431006166500110020476500061021576500084022186500076023026500109023786500092024876510010025796530017025896530014026066530019026206530014026396530015026536530015026686530016026836550020026997730031027198560006027508560198027569030018029541338405  a201212       201211                        eng     aEP83330106  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0134-8  aD72  aD74  aJ12  aJ13  aO15  aO1711aA Micro-level Event-Centered Approach to Investigating Armed Conflict and Population Responses10aWilliams, Nathalie E.10aGhimire, Dirgha J.10aAxinn, William G.10aJennings, Elyse A.10aPradhan, Meeta S.  aCarolina Population Center, U NC  aPopulation Studies Center, U MI  aU MI  aPopulation Studies Center, U MI  aPopulation Studies Center, U MI  aIn this article, we construct and test a micro-level event-centered approach to the study of armed conflict and behavioral responses in the general population. Event-centered approaches have been successfully used in the macro-political study of armed conflict but have not yet been adopted in micro-behavioral studies. The micro-level event-centered approach that we advocate here includes decomposition of a conflict into discrete political and violent events, examination of the mechanisms through which they affect behavior, and consideration of differential risks within the population. We focus on two mechanisms: instability and threat of harm. We test this approach empirically in the context of the recent decade-long armed conflict in Nepal, using detailed measurements of conflict-related events and a longitudinal study of first migration, first marriage, and first contraceptive use. Results demonstrate that different conflict-related events independently shaped migration, marriage, and childbearing and that they can simultaneously influence behaviors in opposing directions. We find that violent events increased migration, but political events slowed migration. Both violent and political events increased marriage and contraceptive use net of migration. Overall, this micro-level event-centered approach yields a significant advance for the study of how armed conflict affects civilian behavioral responses. 4aPolitical Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior         b(D72) 4aConflict; Conflict Resolution; Alliances         b(D74) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aFormal and Informal Sectors; Shadow Economy; Institutional Arrangements         b(O17)  aNepal  aChildbearing  a Conflict  a Contraceptive  a Marriage  a Migration  a Political  a Population  aJournal Article  g49g4h1521-46tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1338405&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201200518naa  2200145   4500001001100000008004400011022001300055037003000068245003300098655001200131773001000143856000600153856020100159903001200360EP83330100       201211                        eng     a00703370  n10.1007/s13524-012-0163-311aAcknowledgment of Reviewers.  aArticle  g49g4  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=EP83330100&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNov201200506naa  2200145   4500001001100000008004400011022001300055037003000068245002100098655001200119773001000131856000600141856020100147903001200348EP83330117       201211                        eng     a00703370  n10.1007/s13524-012-0168-y10aVolume 49 Index.  aArticle  g49g4  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=EP83330117&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNov201202263naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450113002151000021003281100070003495201086004196500038015056500113015436510009016566530011016656530015016766550020016917730030017118560006017418560198017479030016019451313718  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684522  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0107-y  aI12  aJ1510aUncrossing the U.S. Black-White Mortality Crossover: The Role of Cohort Forces in Life Course Mortality Risk10aMasters, Ryan K.  aInstitute for Social and Economic Research and Policy, Columbia U  aIn this article, I examine the black-white crossover in U.S. adult all-cause mortality, emphasizing how cohort effects condition age-specific estimates of mortality risk. I employ hierarchical age-period-cohort methods on the National Health Interview Survey-Linked Mortality Files between 1986 and 2006 to show that the black-white mortality crossover can be uncrossed by factoring out period and cohort effects of mortality risk. That is, when controlling for variations in cohort and period patterns of U.S. adult mortality, the estimated age effects of non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white U.S. adult mortality risk do not cross at any age. This is the case for both men and women. Further, results show that nearly all the recent temporal change in U.S. adult mortality risk was cohort driven. The findings support the contention that the non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white U.S. adult populations experienced disparate cohort patterns of mortality risk and that these different experiences are driving the convergence and crossover of mortality risk at older ages. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aHealth  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g49g3h773-96tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313718&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201202491naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450067002151000020002827000023003021100036003257100036003615201270003976500054016676500038017216510009017596530011017686530012017796530013017916530014018046530015018186530013018336550020018467730031018668560006018978560198019039030016021011313719  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684515  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0108-x  aC51  aI1210aEstimating Smoking-Attributable Mortality in the United States10aFenelon, Andrew10aPreston, Samuel H.  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aTobacco use is the largest single cause of premature death in the developed world. Two methods of estimating the number of deaths attributable to smoking use mortality from lung cancer as an indicator of the damage from smoking. We reestimate the coefficients of one of these, the Preston/Glei/Wilmoth model, using recent data from U.S. states. We calculate smoking-attributable fractions for the 50 states and the United States as a whole in 2004, and estimate the contribution of smoking to the high adult mortality of the southern states. We estimate that 21% of deaths among men and 17% among women were attributable to smoking in 2004. Across states, attributable fractions range from 11% to 30% among men and from 7% to 23% among women. Smoking-related mortality also explains as much as 60% of the mortality disadvantage of southern states compared with other regions. At the national level, our estimates are in close agreement with those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Preston/Glei/Wilmoth, particularly for men, although we find greater variability by state than does CDC. We suggest that our coefficients are suitable for calculating smoking-attributable mortality in contexts with relatively mature epidemics of cigarette smoking. 4aModel Construction and Estimation         b(C51) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aCancer  a Deaths  a Disease  a Epidemic  a Mortality  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g49g3h797-818tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313719&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201202936naa  2200493   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450081002231000021003047000021003257000027003467000022003737000019003957000021004141100009004357100009004447100061004537100009005147100009005237100056005325201286005886500038018746500065019126500108019776510009020856530010020946530013021046530015021176530012021326530015021446530013021596550020021727730030021928560006022228560198022289030016024261313720  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684509  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0104-1  aI12  aI20  aJ1413aThe Significance of Education for Mortality Compression in the United States10aBrown, Dustin C.10aHayward, Mark D.10aMontez, Jennifer Karas10aHummer, Robert A.10aChiu, Chi-Tsun10aHidajat, Mira M.  aU TX  aU TX  aCenter for Population and Development Studies, Harvard U  aU TX  aU TX  aInstitute of Public and International Affairs, U UT  aRecent studies of old-age mortality trends assess whether longevity improvements over time are linked to increasing compression of mortality at advanced ages. The historical backdrop of these studies is the long-term improvement in a population's socioeconomic resources that fueled longevity gains. We extend this line of inquiry by examining whether socioeconomic differences in longevity within a population are accompanied by old-age mortality compression. Specifically, we document educational differences in longevity and mortality compression for older men and women in the United States. Drawing on the fundamental cause of disease framework, we hypothesize that both longevity and compression increase with higher levels of education and that women with the highest levels of education will exhibit the greatest degree of longevity and compression. Results based on the Health and Retirement Study and the National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality File confirm a strong educational gradient in both longevity and mortality compression. We also find that mortality is more compressed within educational groups among women than men. The results suggest that educational attainment in the United States maximizes life chances by delaying the biological aging process. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aAging  a Disease  a Education  a Health  a Mortality  a Old Age  aJournal Article  g49g3h819-40tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313720&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201202585naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450110002151000019003257000022003441100008003667100008003745201486003826500038018686500048019066510009019546530011019636530015019746550020019897730030020098560006020398560198020459030016022431313721  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684507  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0103-2  aI12  aJ4513aThe Long-Term Effects of Military Conscription on Mortality: Estimates from the Vietnam-Era Draft Lottery10aConley, Dalton10aHeerwig, Jennifer  aNYU  aNYU  aResearch on the effects of Vietnam military service suggests that Vietnam veterans experienced significantly higher mortality than the civilian population at large. These results, however, may be biased by nonrandom selection into the military if unobserved background differences between veterans and nonveterans affect mortality directly. To generate unbiased estimates of exposure to conscription on mortality, the present study compares the observed proportion of draft-eligible male decedents born 1950-1952 to the (1) expected proportion of draft-eligible male decedents given Vietnam draft-eligibility cutoffs; and (2) observed proportion of draft-eligible decedent women. The results demonstrate no effect of draft exposure on mortality, including for cause-specific death rates. When we examine population subgroups--including splits by race, educational attainment, nativity, and marital status--we find weak evidence for an interaction between education and draft eligibility. This interaction works in the opposite direction of putative education-enhancing, mortality-reducing effects of conscription that have, in the past, led to concern about a potential exclusion restriction violation in instrumental variable (IV) regression models. We suggest that previous research, which has shown that Vietnam-era veterans experienced significantly higher mortality than nonveterans, might be biased by nonrandom selection into the military and should be further investigated. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aPublic Sector Labor Markets         b(J45)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g49g3h841-55tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313721&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201202239naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450074002231000023002977000020003207000019003401100037003597100015003967100015004115200814004266500038012406500170012786500109014486510010015576530014015676530014015816550020015957730030016158560006016458560198016519030016018491313722  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684519  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0116-x  aI12  aN35  aO1510aMortality from the Influenza Pandemic of 1918-1919: The Case of India10aChandra, Siddharth10aKuljanin, Goran10aWray, Jennifer  aAsian Studies Center, MI State U  aMI State U  aMI State U  aEstimates of worldwide mortality from the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 vary widely, from 15 million to 100 million. In terms of loss of life, India was the focal point of this profound demographic event. In this article, we calculate mortality from the influenza pandemic in India using panel data models and data from the Census of India. The new estimates suggest that for the districts included in the sample, mortality was at most 13.88 million, compared with 17.21 million when calculated using the assumptions of Davis (1951). We conclude that Davis' influential estimate of mortality from influenza in British India is overstated by at least 24%. Future analyses of the effects of the pandemic on demographic change in India and worldwide will need to account for this significant downward revision. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Asia including Middle East         b(N35) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aIndia  aMortality  a Pandemic  aJournal Article  g49g3h857-65tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313722&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201202368naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450068002311000019002997000025003181100011003437100049003545200916004036500069013196500065013886500084014536500065015376510012016026530017016146530014016316530015016456530012016606530016016726550020016887730030017088560006017388560198017449030016019421313723  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684516  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0111-2  aD31  aI20  aJ12  aJ3110aEducational Assortative Mating and Income Inequality in Denmark10aBreen, Richard10aAndersen, Signe Hald  aYale U  aRockwool Fondens Forskningsenhed, Copenhagen  aMany writers have expressed a concern that growing educational assortative mating will lead to greater inequality between households in their earnings or income. In this article, we examine the relationship between educational assortative mating and income inequality in Denmark between 1987 and 2006. Denmark is widely known for its low level of income inequality, but the Danish case provides a good test of the relationship between educational assortative mating and inequality because although income inequality increased over the period we consider, educational homogamy declined. Using register data on the exact incomes of the whole population, we find that change in assortative mating increased income inequality but that these changes were driven by changes in the educational distributions of men and women rather than in the propensity for people to choose a partner with a given level of education. 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31)  aDenmark  aDistribution  a Earnings  a Education  a Income  a Inequality  aJournal Article  g49g3h867-87tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313723&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201202602naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450109002151000021003241100008003455201333003536500113016866500172017996510009019716530015019806530010019956530012020056550020020177730031020378560006020688560198020749030016022721313724  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684510  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0105-0  aJ15  aR2310aTemporary Integration, Resilient Inequality: Race and Neighborhood Change in the Transition to Adulthood10aSharkey, Patrick  aNYU  aThis article focuses on neighborhood and geographic change arising with the first "selection" of an independent residential setting: the transition out of the family home. Data from two sources--the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics--are used to provide complementary analyses of trajectories of change in geographic location and neighborhood racial and economic composition during young adulthood. Findings indicate that for young adults who originate in segregated urban areas and remain in such areas, the period of young adulthood is characterized by continuity in neighborhood conditions and persistent racial inequality from childhood to adulthood. For young adults who exit highly segregated urban areas, this period is characterized by a substantial leveling of racial inequality, with African Americans moving into less-poor, less-segregated neighborhoods. However, the trend toward racial equality in young adulthood is temporary, as the gaps between whites and blacks grow as the young adults move further into adulthood. Crucial to the reemergence of racial inequality in neighborhood environments is the process of "unselected" change, or change in neighborhood conditions that occurs around young adults after they move to a new neighborhood environment. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aInequality  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g49g3h889-912tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313724&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201202053naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450091002231000022003141100039003365200732003756500038011076500076011456500109012216510016013306530014013466530012013606530019013726530015013916530015014066550020014217730030014418560006014718560198014779030016016751313725  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684524  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0120-1  aI12  aJ13  aO1510aChildhood Circumstances and the Intergenerational Transmission of Socioeconomic Status10aCarvalho, Leandro  aRAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aA large literature has documented the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status (SES).

This article investigates whether characteristics determined in childhood play an important role in the intergenerational transmission. Using data from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, I document the extent to which childhood human capital accounts for the intergenerational SES correlation. My results imply that childhood health and nutrition, cognitive and noncognitive abilities, and early schooling account for between one-third and one-half of the relationship between parents' SES and their offspring's SES. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aPhilippines  aChildhood  a Health  a Human Capital  a Nutrition  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g49g3h913-38tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313725&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201202192naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450055002311000022002867000027003087000023003351100025003587100015003837100013003985200808004116500059012196500065012786500053013436500065013966510009014616530013014706530016014836530013014996550020015127730030015328560006015628560198015689030016017661313726  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684513  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0100-5  aD12  aI20  aJ22  aJ3110aLeisure Inequality in the United States: 1965-200310aSevilla, Almudena20aGimenez-Nadal, Jose I.10aGershuny, Jonathan  aQueen Mary, U London  aU Zaragoza  aU Oxford  aThis article exploits the complex sequential structure of the diary data in the American Heritage Time Use Study (AHTUS) and constructs three classes of indicators that capture the quality of leisure (pure leisure, co-present leisure, and leisure fragmentation) to show that the relative growth in leisure time enjoyed by low-educated individuals documented in previous studies has been accompanied by a relative decrease in the quality of that leisure time.

Starting in 1860 (before the onset of the decline), this study follows marital fertility trends until 1939, when fertility reached lower levels than ever before. Using data from the Historical Sample of the Netherlands (HSN), this study shows that mortality decline, a rise in real income, and unemployment account for the decline in the Netherlands. This finding suggests that marital fertility decline was an adjustment to social and economic change, leaving little room for attitudinal change that is independent of social and economic change. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aNetherlands  aChild  a Fertility  a Marital  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g49g3h965-88tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313727&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201202401naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450061002151000016002767000024002921100013003167100021003295201173003506500076015236500066015996510009016656530013016746530014016876530015017016530014017166530014017306530011017446550020017557730032017758560006018078560198018139030016020111313728  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684521  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0113-0  aJ13  aJ1610aTrends in Self-Reported Spontaneous Abortions: 1970-200010aLang, Kevin20aNuevo-Chiquero, Ana  aBoston U  aIEB, U Barcelona  aLittle is known about how the miscarriage rate has changed over the past few decades in the United States. Data from Cycles IV to VI of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) were used to examine trends from 1970 to 2000. After accounting for abortion availability and the characteristics of pregnant women, the rate of reported miscarriages increased by about 1.0% per year. This upward trend is strongest in the first seven weeks and absent after 12 weeks of pregnancy. African American and Hispanic women report lower rates of early miscarriage than do whites. The probability of reporting a miscarriage rises by about 5% per year of completed schooling. The upward trend, especially in early miscarriages, suggests awareness of pregnancy rather than prenatal care to be a key factor in explaining the evolution of self-reported miscarriages. Any beneficial effects of prenatal care on early miscarriage are obscured by this factor. Differences in adoption of early-awareness technology, such as home pregnancy tests, should be taken into account when analyzing results from self-reports or clinical trials relying on awareness of pregnancy in its early weeks. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aAbortion  a Adoption  a Pregnancy  a Pregnant  a Prenatal  a Women  aJournal Article  g49g3h989-1009tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313728&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201202659naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450086002311000023003177000023003401100051003637100009004145201308004236500047017316500052017786500038018306500109018686510011019776530009019886530017019976550020020147730031020348560006020658560198020719030016022691313729  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684523  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0119-7  aD84  aI11  aI12  aO1513aThe Impact of HIV Testing on Subjective Expectations and Risky Behavior in Malawi10aDelavande, Adeline10aKohler, Hans-Peter  aU Essex and RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aU PA  aWe investigate the causal impact of learning HIV status on HIV/AIDS-related expectations and sexual behavior in the medium run. Our analyses document several unexpected results about the effect of learning one's own, or one's spouse's, HIV status. For example, receiving an HIV-negative test result implies higher subjective expectations about being HIV-positive after two years, and individuals tend to have larger prediction errors about their HIV status after learning their HIV status. If individuals in HIV-negative couples also learn the status of their spouse, these effects disappear. In terms of behavioral outcomes, our analyses document that HIV-positive individuals who learned their status reported having fewer partners and using condoms more often than those who did not learn their status. Among married respondents in HIV-negative couples, learning only one's own status increases risky behavior, while learning both statuses decreases risky behavior. In addition, individuals in sero-discordant couples who learned both statuses are more likely to report some condom use. Overall, our analyses suggest that ensuring that each spouse learns the HIV status of the other, either through couple's testing or through spousal communication, may be beneficial in high-prevalence environments. 4aExpectations; Speculations         b(D84) 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMalawi  aAIDS  a Expectation  aJournal Article  g49g3h1011-36tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313729&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201203192naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450045002231000018002687000015002861100022003017100057003235201903003806500056022836500077023396500108024166510009025246530017025336530021025506550020025717730031025918560006026228560198026289030016028261313730  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684514  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0106-z  aH55  aJ11  aJ1410aStatistical Security for Social Security10aSoneji, Samir10aKing, Gary  aDartmouth College  aInstitute for Quantitative Social Science, Harvard U  aThe financial viability of Social Security, the single largest U.S. government program, depends on accurate forecasts of the solvency of its intergenerational trust fund. We begin by detailing information necessary for replicating the Social Security Administration's (SSA's) forecasting procedures, which until now has been unavailable in the public domain. We then offer a way to improve the quality of these procedures via age- and sex-specific mortality forecasts. The most recent SSA mortality forecasts were based on the best available technology at the time, which was a combination of linear extrapolation and qualitative judgments. Unfortunately, linear extrapolation excludes known risk factors and is inconsistent with long-standing demographic patterns, such as the smoothness of age profiles. Modern statistical methods typically outperform even the best qualitative judgments in these contexts. We show how to use such methods, enabling researchers to forecast using far more information, such as the known risk factors of smoking and obesity and known demographic patterns. Including this extra information makes a substantial difference. For example, by improving only mortality forecasting methods, we predict three fewer years of net surplus, $730 billion less in Social Security Trust Funds, and program costs that are 0.66% greater for projected taxable payroll by 2,031 compared with SSA projections. More important than specific numerical estimates are the advantages of transparency, replicability, reduction of uncertainty, and what may be the resulting lower vulnerability to the politicization of program forecasts. In addition, by offering with this article software and detailed replication information, we hope to marshal the efforts of the research community to include ever more informative inputs and to continue to reduce uncertainties in Social Security forecasts. 4aSocial Security and Public Pensions         b(H55) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Social Security  aJournal Article  g49g3h1037-60tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313730&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201202191naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450126002231000017003497000025003661100009003917100040004005200892004406500077013326500033014096500065014426510009015076530011015166530015015276530016015426550020015587730031015788560006016098560198016159030016018131313731  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684512  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0110-3  aJ11  aJ23  aJ6110aInterstate Migration Has Fallen Less Than You Think: Consequences of Hot Deck Imputation in the Current Population Survey10aKaplan, Greg20aSchulhofer-Wohl, Sam  aU PA  aFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis  aWe show that much of the recent reported decrease in interstate migration is a statistical artifact. Before 2006, the Census Bureau's imputation procedure for dealing with missing data in the Current Population Survey inflated the estimated interstate migration rate. An undocumented change in the procedure corrected the problem starting in 2006, thus reducing the estimated migration rate. The change in imputation procedures explains 90% of the reported decrease in interstate migration between 2005 and 2006, and 42% of the decrease between 2000 (the recent high-water mark) and 2010. After we remove the effect of the change in procedures, we find that the annual interstate migration rate follows a smooth downward trend from 1996 to 2010. Contrary to popular belief, the 2007-2009 recession is not associated with any additional decrease in interstate migration relative to trend. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aLabor Demand         b(J23) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Migration  a Population  aJournal Article  g49g3h1061-74tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313731&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201202603naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450082002231000021003057000018003261100016003447100015003605201245003756500038016206500084016586500109017426510023018516530014018746530014018886530014019026530016019166530012019326550020019447730033019648560006019978560198020039030016022011313732  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684518  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0114-z  aI12  aJ12  aO1510aPolygyny, Partnership Concurrency, and HIV Transmission in Sub-Saharan Africa10aReniers, Georges10aTfaily, Rania  aPrinceton U  aCarleton U  aWe study the relationship between polygyny and HIV infection using nationally representative survey data with linked serostatus information from 20 African countries. Our results indicate that junior wives in polygynous unions are more likely to be HIV positive than spouses of monogamous men, but also that HIV prevalence is lower in populations with more polygyny. With these results in mind, we investigate four explanations for the contrasting individual- and ecological-level associations. These relate to (1) the adverse selection of HIV-positive women into polygynous unions, (2) the sexual network structure characteristic of polygyny, (3) the relatively low coital frequency in conjugal dyads of polygynous marriages (coital dilution), and (4) the restricted access to sexual partners for younger men in populations where polygynous men presumably monopolize the women in their community (monopolizing polygynists). We find evidence for some of these mechanisms, and together they support the proposition that polygynous marriage systems impede the spread of HIV. We relate these results to the debate about partnership concurrency as a primary behavioral driver for the fast propagation of HIV in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSub-Saharan Africa  aInfection  a Marriage  a Polygyny  a Population  a Spouse  aJournal Article  g49g3h1075-1101tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313732&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201202216naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450107002151000020003221100015003425201057003576500077014146500084014916510009015756530017015846530014016016530016016156550020016317730031016518560006016828560198016889030016018861313733  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684508  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0102-3  aJ11  aJ1210aUnion Formation in Later Life: Economic Determinants of Cohabitation and Remarriage among Older Adults10aVespa, Jonathan  aOH State U  aThis study builds on Becker's and Oppenheimer's theories of union formation to examine the economic determinants of marriage and cohabitation during older adulthood. Based on the 1998-2006 Health and Retirement Study and a sample of previously married Americans who are at least 50 years old, results show that wealthier older adults, regardless of gender, are more likely to repartner than stay single. Wealth has no discernable effect on the likelihood of remarrying versus cohabiting. Among the oldest men, the positive associations between wealth and repartnering are entirely due to housing assets. Results suggest that Oppenheimer's theory of marriage timing may be more applicable to later-life union formation than Becker's independence hypothesis. Further, economic disadvantage does not appear to characterize later-life cohabitation, unlike cohabitation during young adulthood. These findings help illuminate the union formation process during older adulthood and are timely considering demographic changes reshaping the American population. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Marriage  a Population  aJournal Article  g49g3h1103-25tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313733&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201203066naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450091002311000025003227000018003471100022003657100048003875201531004356500038019666500073020046500117020776500076021946510009022706530015022796530015022946530014023096530012023236530015023356530023023506550020023737730031023938560006024248560198024309030016026281313734  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684517  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0115-y  aI12  aI18  aI38  aJ1313aThe Effects of Childhood SNAP Use and Neighborhood Conditions on Adult Body Mass Index10aVartanian, Thomas P.10aHouser, Linda  aBryn Mawr College  aCenter for Social Work Education, Widener U  aThe disproportionate number of individuals who are obese or overweight in the low-income U.S. population has raised interest in the influence of neighborhood conditions and public assistance programs on weight and health. Generally, neighborhood effects and program participation effects have been explored in separate studies. We unite these two areas of inquiry, using the 1968-2005 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to examine the long-term effects of childhood Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation, neighborhood conditions, and the interaction of these two, on adult body mass index (BMI). Using sibling fixed-effects models to account for selection bias, we find that relative to children in other low-income families, children in SNAP-recipient households have higher average adult BMI values. However, the effects of childhood SNAP usage are sensitive to both residential neighborhood and age at receipt. For those growing up in advantaged neighborhoods, projected adult BMI is higher for children in SNAP-recipient households than for children in low-income, nonrecipient households. In contrast, for those growing up in less-advantaged areas, adult BMI differences between children in SNAP-recipient and those in low-income, nonrecipient households are small. SNAP usage during preschool years (0 to 4) has no impact on adult BMI scores. However, at later childhood ages, the time elapsed receiving SNAP income increases adult BMI values relative to a condition of low-income nonreceipt. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18) 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAssistance  a Childhood  a Children  a Health  a Nutrition  a Public Assistance  aJournal Article  g49g3h1127-54tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313734&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201201308naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450121002231000026003441100009003706500065003796500113004446500109005576510011006666530015006776530010006926530012007026550020007147730028007348560006007628560198007689030016009661313735  a201208       201208                        eng     aEP77684511  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0109-9  aI20  aJ15  aO1510aEducational Inequality by Race in Brazil, 1982-2007: Structural Changes and Shifts in Racial Classification: Erratum10aMarteleto, Leticia J.  aU TX 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBrazil  aInequality  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g49g3h1155tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1313735&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201203425naa  2200469   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002310430008002392450192002471000016004397000027004551100046004827100013005285201431005416500038019726500077020106500113020876500109022006500155023096500098024646510018025626530011025806530015025916530029026066530015026356530016026506530021026666550020026877730031027078560006027388560198027449030013029421295370  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088947  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0088-2  aI12  aJ11  aJ15  aO15  aP36  aZ1310aMental Health Consequences of International Migration for Vietnamese Americans and the Mediating Effects of Physical Health and Social Networks: Results from a Natural Experiment Approach10aFu, Hongyun10aVanLandingham, Mark J.  aPopulation Services International, Yunnan  aTulane U  aAlthough the existing literature on immigrant mental health is extensive, major substantive and methodological gaps remain. Substantively, there is little population-based research that focuses on the mental health consequences of migration for Vietnamese Americans. More generally, although a wide range of mental health problems among immigrants has been identified, the potential causal or mediating mechanisms underlying these problems remain elusive. This latter substantive shortcoming is related to a key methodological challenge involving the potentially confounding effects of selection on migration-related outcomes. This article addresses these challenges by employing a "natural experiment" design, involving comparisons among three population-based samples of Vietnamese immigrants, never-leavers, and returnees (N = 709). Data were collected in Ho Chi Minh City and in New Orleans between 2003 and 2005. The study investigates the long-term impact of international migration on Vietnamese mental health, and the potential mediating effects of social networks and physical health on these migration-related outcomes. The results reveal both mental health advantages and disadvantages among Vietnamese immigrants relative to the two groups of Vietnamese nationals. Selection can be ruled out for some of these differences, and both social networks and physical health are found to play important explanatory roles. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aU.S.; Vietnam  aHealth  a Immigrant  a International Migration  a Migration  a Population  a Social Networks  aJournal Article  g49g2h393-424tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295370&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201202890naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450085002231000019003087000017003271100012003447100036003565201411003926500038018036500077018416500155019186510017020736530011020906530016021016530015021176530016021326530012021486530015021606530013021756530013021886550020022017730030022218560006022518560198022579030013024551295371  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088940  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0099-7  aI12  aJ11  aP3610aMigrant Selection and the Health of U.S. Immigrants from the Former Soviet Union10aMehta, Neil K.10aElo, Irma T.  aEmory U  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aFew prior studies have investigated the health of U.S. immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU). Utilizing data from the 2000 U.S. census and the 2000-2007 National Health Interview Survey (NIHS), we compare levels of disability of FSU immigrants with U.S.-born whites (ages 50-84). Our findings suggest an "epidemiologic paradox" in that FSU immigrants possess higher levels of education compared with U.S.-born whites, but report considerably higher disability with and without adjustment for education. Nonetheless, FSU immigrants report lower levels of smoking and heavy alcohol use compared with U.S.-born whites. We further investigate disability by period of arrival among FSU immigrants. Changes in Soviet emigration policies conceivably altered the level of health selectivity among emigres. We find evidence that FSU immigrants who emigrated during a period when a permission to emigrate was hard to obtain (1970-1986) displayed less disability compared with those who emigrated when these restrictions were less stringent (1987-2000). Finally, we compare disability among Russian-born U.S. immigrants with that of those residing in Russia as a direct test of health selectivity. We find that Russian immigrants report lower levels of disability compared with Russians in Russia, suggesting that they are positively selected for health despite their poor health relative to U.S.-born whites. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36)  aRussia; U.S.  aCensus  a Disability  a Education  a Emigration  a Health  a Immigrant  a Migrant  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g49g2h425-47tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295371&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201203140naa  2200481   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002312450095002391000018003347000020003521100072003727100009004445201374004536500044018276500065018716500084019366500109020206500098021296510017022276530017022446530015022616530029022766530013023056530014023186530013023326530015023456530019023606530012023796550020023917730030024118560006024418560198024479030013026451295372  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088941  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0095-y  aF22  aI20  aJ12  aO15  aZ1310aInternational Migration and Educational Assortative Mating in Mexico and the United States10aChoi, Kate H.10aMare, Robert D.  aBendheim Thomas Center for Research on Child Wellbeing, Princeton U  aUCLA  aThis paper examines the relationship between migration and marriage by describing how the distributions of marital statuses and assortative mating patterns vary by individual and community experiences of migration. In Mexico, migrants and those living in areas with high levels of out-migration are more likely to be in heterogamous unions. This is because migration increases the relative attractiveness of single return migrants while disproportionately reducing the number of marriageable men in local marriage markets. In the United States, the odds of homogamy are lower for migrants compared with nonmigrants; however, they do not vary depending on the volume of migration in communities. Migrants are more likely than nonmigrants to "marry up" educationally because the relatively small size of this group compels them to expand their pool of potential spouses to include nonmigrants, who tend to be better educated than they are. Among migrants, the odds of marrying outside of one's education group increase the most among the least educated. In Mexican communities with high rates of out-migration, the odds of marrying outside of one's education group are highest among those with the highest level of education. These findings suggest that migration disrupts preferences and opportunities for homogamy by changing social arrangements and normative climates. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aMexico; U.S.  aDistribution  a Education  a International Migration  a Marital  a Marriage  a Migrant  a Migration  a Out Migration  a Spouse  aJournal Article  g49g2h449-76tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295372&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201203002naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002312450092002391000024003311100015003555201416003706500065017866500077018516500084019286500076020126500113020886510009022016530011022106530014022216530015022356530013022506530015022636530012022786530011022906550020023017730030023218560006023518560198023579030013025551295373  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088950  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0091-2  aI20  aJ11  aJ12  aJ13  aJ1510aMigration Processes, Familial Characteristics, and Schooling Dropout among Black Youths10aThomas, Kevin J. A.  aPA State U  aThis study uses data from the 2000 U.S. census to examine whether the schooling advantage of black immigrants' children found in previous studies is robust. According to the results, the advantage associated with having migrant parents is not restricted to the children of immigrants. Black migrant parents, regardless of foreign-born status, have children with favorable schooling outcomes. Such parental-level influences, however, seem stronger among some immigrant groups than among native internal migrants. The study also suggests that the collective advantage of the children of immigrants is driven by positive migrant selectivity. Accordingly, comparisons between the children of native migrants and children in various immigrant groups reveal that the immigrant advantage is not robust. In fact, the results suggest that when immigrant ethnicity is considered, some children of immigrants may be disadvantaged relative to the children of native migrants. Among recent migrants, the children of native internal migrants also have more favorable outcomes than the children of immigrants, although these differences disappear after background factors are controlled. Further, internal-migrant and immigrant households are less likely to have characteristics that adversely affect schooling than nonmigrant households. Unsurprisingly, the children of nonmigrants have the worst outcomes among black youths. 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Children  a Immigrant  a Migrant  a Migration  a Parent  a Youth  aJournal Article  g49g2h477-98tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295373&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201202798naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450078002311000019003097000024003287000020003527000020003721100044003927100009004367100044004457100044004895201219005336500038017526500073017906500113018636500071019766510009020476530011020566530012020676530017020796550020020967730031021168560006021478560198021539030013023511295374  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088937  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0098-8  aI12  aI18  aJ15  aL8313aThe Income and Health Effects of Tribal Casino Gaming on American Indians10aWolfe, Barbara10aJakubowski, Jessica10aHaveman, Robert10aCourey, Marissa  aInstitute for Research on Poverty, U WI  aU WI  aInstitute for Research on Poverty, U WI  aInstitute for Research on Poverty, U WI  aThe legalization of American Indian casino gaming in the late 1980s allows examination of the relationship between income and health in a quasi-experimental way. Revenue from gaming accrues to individual tribes and has been used both to supplement tribe members' income and to finance tribal infrastructure. We assembled annual data from 1988-2003 on tribal gaming, health care access (from the Area Resource File), and individual health and socioeconomic characteristics data (from the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System). We use this information within a structural, difference-in-differences framework to study the effect of casino gaming on tribal members' income, health status, access to health care, and health-related behaviors. Our difference-in-differences framework relies on before-after comparisons among American Indians whose tribe has at some time operated a casino and with-without comparisons between American Indians whose tribe has and those whose tribe has not initiated gaming. Our results provide identified estimates of the positive effect of gaming on American Indian income and on several indicators of American Indian health, health-related behaviors, and access to health care. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aSports; Gambling; Restaurants; Recreation; Tourism         b(L83)  aU.S.  aCasino  a Health  a Health Care  aJournal Article  g49g2h499-524tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295374&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201203160naa  2200517   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450124002311000019003557000023003747000016003977000018004131100016004317100017004477100063004647100060005275201396005876500038019836500065020216500076020866500066021626510012022286530010022406530014022506530015022646530012022796530016022916530013023076530013023206530015023336530014023486530013023626550020023757730030023958560006024258560198024319030013026291295375  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088944  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0092-1  aI12  aI20  aJ13  aJ1610aPrenatal Health, Educational Attainment, and Intergenerational Inequality: The Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 Study10aHarkonen, Juho10aKaymakcalan, Hande10aMaki, Pirjo10aTaanila, Anja  aStockholm U  aBahcesehir U  aInstitute of Clinical Medicine, U Oulu and Oulu U Hospital  aInstitute of Health Sciences,U Oulu and Oulu U Hospital  aIn this article, we study the effects of prenatal health on educational attainment and on the reproduction of family background inequalities in education. Using Finnish birth cohort data, we analyze several maternal and fetal health variables, many of which have not been featured in the literature on long-term socioeconomic effects of health despite the effects of these variables on birth and short-term health outcomes. We find strong negative effects of mother's prenatal smoking on educational attainment, which are stronger if the mother smoked heavily but are not significant if she quit during the first trimester. Anemia during pregnancy is also associated with lower levels of attained education. Other indicators of prenatal health (pre-pregnancy obesity, mother's antenatal depressed mood, hypertension and preeclampsia, early prenatal care visits, premature birth, and small size for gestational age) do not predict educational attainment. Our measures explain little of the educational inequalities by parents' class or education. However, smoking explains 12%--and all health variables together, 19%--of the lower educational attainment of children born to unmarried mothers. Our findings point to the usefulness of proximate health measures in addition to general ones. They also point to the potentially important role played by early health in intergenerational processes. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aFinland  aBirth  a Children  a Education  a Health  a Inequality  a Mothers  a Obesity  a Pregnancy  a Prenatal  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g49g2h525-52tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295375&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201202434naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450097002151000020003121100016003325201255003486500113016036500066017166510009017826530017017916530012018086530010018206530011018306550020018417730030018618560006018918560198018979030013020951295376  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088946  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0089-1  aJ15  aJ1610aBlack-White Disparities in Life Expectancy: How Much Can the Standard SES Variables Explain?10aGeruso, Michael  aPrinceton U  aThis article quantifies the extent to which socioeconomic and demographic characteristics can account for black-white disparities in life expectancy in the United States. Although many studies have investigated the linkages between race, socioeconomic status, and mortality, this article is the first to measure how much of the life expectancy gap remains after differences in mortality are purged of the compositional differences in socioeconomic characteristics between blacks and whites. The decomposition is facilitated by a reweighting technique that creates counterfactual estimation samples in which the distribution of income, education, employment and occupation, marital status, and other theoretically relevant variables among blacks is made to match the distribution of these variables among whites. For males, 80% of the black-white gap in life expectancy at age 1 can be accounted for by differences in socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. For females, 70% percent of the gap is accounted for. Labor force participation, occupation, and (among women only) marital status have almost no additional power to explain the black-white disparity in life expectancy after precise measures for income and education are controlled for. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Female  a Race  a Women  aJournal Article  g49g2h553-74tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295376&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201202459naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450065002151000015002807000021002957000019003167000017003357000021003527000024003731100013003977100017004107100018004277100015004457100015004607100018004755201135004936500038016286500066016666530011017326530015017436530011017586550020017697730031017898560006018208560198018269030013020241295377  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088938  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0096-x  aI12  aJ1610aWidowhood and Mortality: A Meta-analysis and Meta-regression10aShor, Eran10aRoelfs, David J.10aCurreli, Misty10aClemow, Lynn10aBurg, Matthew M.10aSchwartz, Joseph E.  aMcGill U  aU Louisville  aStony Brook U  aColumbia U  aColumbia U  aStony Brook U  aThe study of spousal bereavement and mortality has long been a major topic of interest for social scientists, but much remains unknown with respect to important moderating factors, such as age, follow-up duration, and geographic region. The present study examines these factors using meta-analysis. Keyword searches were conducted in multiple electronic databases, supplemented by extensive iterative hand searches. We extracted 1,377 mortality risk estimates from 123 publications, providing data on more than 500 million persons. Compared with married people, widowers had a mean hazard ratio (HR) of 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-1.28) among HRs adjusted for age and additional covariates and a high subjective quality score. The mean HR was higher for men (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.19-1.35) than for women (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.08-1.22). A significant interaction effect was found between gender and mean age, with HRs decreasing more rapidly for men than for women as age increased. Other significant predictors of HR magnitude included sample size, geographic region, level of statistical adjustment, and study quality. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aGender  a Mortality  a Women  aJournal Article  g49g2h575-606tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295377&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201202508naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450120002231000014003431100065003575201239004226500038016616500084016996500066017836510010018496530011018596530018018706530015018886550020019037730030019238560006019538560198019599030013021571295378  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088939  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0101-4  aI12  aJ12  aJ1610aEstimating Mortality Differences in Developed Countries from Survey Information on Maternal and Paternal Orphanhood10aLuy, Marc  aVienna Institute of Demography, Austrian Academy of Sciences  aIn general, the use of indirect methods is limited to developing countries. Developed countries are usually assumed to have no need to apply such methods because detailed demographic data exist. However, the potentialities of demographic analysis with direct methods are limited to the characteristics of available macro data on births, deaths, and migration. For instance, in many Western countries, official population statistics do not permit the estimation of mortality by socioeconomic status (SES) or migration background, or for estimating the relationship between parity and mortality. In order to overcome these shortcomings, I modify and extend the so-called orphanhood method for indirect estimation of adult mortality from survey information on maternal and paternal survival to allow its application to populations of developed countries. The method is demonstrated and tested with data from two independent Italian cross-sectional surveys by estimating overall and SES-specific life expectancy. The empirical applications reveal that the proposed method can be used successfully for estimating levels and trends of mortality differences in developed countries and thus offers new prospects for the analysis of mortality. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aItaly  aDeaths  a Demographics  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g49g2h607-27tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295378&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201202744naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450146002231000027003697000020003961100009004167100009004255201358004346500065017926500084018576500066019416510009020076530012020166530013020286530025020416530014020666530011020806550020020917730030021118560006021418560198021479030013023451295379  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088936  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0093-0  aI20  aJ12  aJ1613aThe Proximate Determinants of Educational Homogamy: The Effects of First Marriage, Marital Dissolution, Remarriage, and Educational Upgrading10aSchwartz, Christine R.10aMare, Robert D.  aU WI  aUCLA  aThis paper adapts the population balancing equation to develop a framework for studying the proximate determinants of educational homogamy. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on a cohort of women born between 1957 and 1964, we decompose the odds of homogamy in prevailing marriages into four proximate determinants: (1) first marriages, (2) first and later marital dissolutions, (3) remarriages, and (4) educational attainment after marriage. The odds of homogamy among new first marriages are lower than among prevailing marriages, but not because of selective marital dissolution, remarriage, and educational attainment after marriage, as has been speculated. Prevailing marriages are more likely to be educationally homogamous than new first marriages because of the accumulation of homogamous first marriages in the stock of marriages. First marriages overwhelmingly account for the odds of homogamy in prevailing marriages in this cohort. Marital dissolutions, remarriages, and educational upgrades after marriage have relatively small and offsetting effects. Our results suggest that, despite the high prevalence of divorce, remarriage, and continued schooling after marriage in the United States, the key to understanding trends in educational homogamy lies primarily in variation in assortative mating into first marriage. 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aDivorce  a Marital  a Marital Dissolution  a Marriage  a Women  aJournal Article  g49g2h629-50tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295379&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201202406naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450065002151000019002807000023002997000024003221100015003467100015003617100020003765201109003966500084015056500113015896510009017026530012017116530014017236530016017376530012017536550020017657730030017858560006018158560198018219030013020191295380  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088945  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0090-3  aJ12  aJ1510aCrossing Boundaries: Nativity, Ethnicity, and Mate Selection10aQian, Zhenchao10aGlick, Jennifer E.10aBatson, Christie D.  aOH State U  aAZ State U  aU NV, Las Vegas  aThe influx of immigrants has increased diversity among ethnic minorities and indicates that they may take multiple integration paths in American society. Previous research on ethnic integration has often focused on panethnic differences, and few have explored ethnic diversity within a racial or panethnic context. Using 2000 U.S. census data for Puerto Rican-, Mexican-, Chinese-, and Filipino-origin individuals, we examine differences in marriage and cohabitation with whites, with other minorities, within a panethnic group, and within an ethnic group by nativity status. Ethnic endogamy is strong and, to a lesser extent, so is panethnic endogamy. Yet, marital or cohabiting unions with whites remain an important path of integration but differ significantly by ethnicity, nativity, age at arrival, and educational attainment. Meanwhile, ethnic differences in marriage and cohabitation with other racial or ethnic minorities are strong. Our analysis supports that unions with whites remain a major path of integration, but other paths of integration also become viable options for all ethnic groups. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aMarital  a Marriage  a Minorities  a Racial  aJournal Article  g49g2h651-75tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295380&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201203289naa  2200481   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450100002311000021003317000023003527000022003757000035003977000020004327000012004521100009004647100026004737100012004997100093005117100036006047100040006405201405006806500076020856500067021616500109022286500109023376510047024466530016024936530015025096530016025246550020025407730030025608560006025908560198025969030013027941295381  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088943  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0097-9  aJ13  aO11  aO15  aO4710aInternational Fertility Change: New Data and Insights from the Developmental Idealism Framework10aThornton, Arland10aBinstock, Georgina10aYount, Kathryn M.20aAbbasi-Shavazi, Mohammad Jalal10aGhimire, Dirgha10aXie, Yu  aU MI  aCONICET, Buenos Aires  aEmory U  aAustralian Demographic and Social Research Institute, Australian National U and U Tehran  aPopulation Studies Center, U MI  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aMany scholars have offered structural and ideational explanations for the fertility changes occurring around the world. This paper focuses on the influence of developmental idealism--a schema or set of beliefs endorsing development, fertility change, and causal connections between development and fertility. Developmental idealism is argued to be an important force affecting both population policy and the fertility behavior of ordinary people. We present new survey data from ordinary people in six countries--Argentina, China, Egypt, Iran, Nepal, and the United States--about the extent to which developmental idealism is known and believed. We ask individuals if they believe that fertility and development are correlated, that development is a causal force in changing fertility levels, and that fertility declines enhance the standard of living and intergenerational relations. We also ask people about their expectations concerning future trends in fertility in their countries and whether they approve or disapprove of the trends they expect. The data show widespread linkage in the minds of ordinary people between fertility and development. Large fractions of people in these six settings believe that fertility and development are correlated, that development reduces fertility, and that declines in fertility foster development. Many also expect and endorse future declines in fertility. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMacroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development         b(O11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aMeasurement of Economic Growth; Aggregate Productivity; Cross-Country Output Convergence         b(O47)  aArgentina; China; Egypt; Iran; Nepal; U.S.  aDevelopment  a Fertility  a Population  aJournal Article  g49g2h677-98tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295381&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201203335naa  2200589   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002310430008002390430008002472450085002551000024003407000017003647000018003817000020003991100029004197100029004487100029004777100057005065201087005636500071016506500076017216500066017976500067018636500109019306500119020396500172021586510017023306530010023476530014023576530018023716530012023896530012024016530016024136530013024296530013024426530011024556530011024666550020024777730031024978560006025288560198025349030013027321295382  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088948  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0087-3  aD13  aJ13  aJ16  aO12  aO15  aO18  aR2310aChild Mobility, Maternal Status, and Household Composition in Rural South Africa10aMadhavan, Sangeetha10aSchatz, Enid10aClark, Samuel10aCollinson, Mark  aU MD and U Witwatersrand  aU MO and U Witwatersrand  aU WA and U Witwatersrand  aU Witwatersrand and Centre for Global Health, Umea U  aThis article examines the influence of maternal status, socioeconomic status of the household, and household composition on the mobility of children aged 0-14 in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, from 1999 to 2008. Using data from the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System, we found that children whose mothers were temporary migrants, living elsewhere, or dead had higher odds of moving than children whose mothers were coresident. Older children and children living in richer households faced lower odds of mobility. For children whose mothers were coresident, there was no effect of maternal substitutes on child mobility. However, among children whose mothers were temporary migrants or living elsewhere, the presence of prime-aged and elderly females lowered the odds of mobility. For maternal orphans, the presence of elderly women in the household lowered their odds of mobility. The results underscore the importance of examining the conditions under which children move in order to strengthen service delivery targeted at safeguarding children's well-being. 4aHousehold Production and Intrahousehold Allocation         b(D13) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aMicroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development         b(O12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aSouth Africa  aChild  a Children  a Demographics  a Female  a Health  a Households  a Migrant  a Mothers  a Rural  a Women  aJournal Article  g49g2h699-718tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295382&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201202876naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450109002231000017003327000022003491100011003717100018003825201470004006500056018706500117019266500066020436510018021096530017021276530013021446530012021576530010021696530019021796530013021986550020022117730030022318560006022618560198022679030013024651295383  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088942  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-012-0094-z  aI32  aI38  aJ1610aTargeting, Universalism, and Single-Mother Poverty: A Multilevel Analysis across 18 Affluent Democracies10aBrady, David10aBurroway, Rebekah  aDuke U  aStony Brook U  aWe examine the influence of individual characteristics and targeted and universal social policy on single-mother poverty with a multilevel analysis across 18 affluent Western democracies. Although single mothers are disproportionately poor in all countries, there is even more cross-national variation in single-mother poverty than in poverty among the overall population. By far, the United States has the highest rate of poverty among single mothers among affluent democracies. The analyses show that single-mother poverty is a function of the household's employment, education, and age composition, and the presence of other adults in the household. Beyond individual characteristics, social policy exerts substantial influence on single-mother poverty. We find that two measures of universal social policy significantly reduce single-mother poverty. However, one measure of targeted social policy does not have significant effects, and another measure is significantly negative only when controlling for universal social policy. Moreover, the effects of universal social policy are larger. Additional analyses show that universal social policy does not have counterproductive consequences in terms of family structure or employment, while the results are less clear for targeted social policy. Although debates often focus on altering the behavior or characteristics of single mothers, welfare universalism could be an even more effective anti-poverty strategy. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aSelected MDCs  aAnti Poverty  a Mothers  a Policy  a Poor  a Single Mother  a Welfare  aJournal Article  g49g2h719-46tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295383&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201203122naa  2200481   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002312450100002391000023003397000017003627000023003791100019004027100014004217100014004355201476004496500065019256500076019906500066020666500083021326500065022156510009022806530010022896530014022996530015023136530013023286530011023416530010023526530011023626550020023737730030023938560006024238560198024299030013026271295384  a201205       201205                        eng     aEP74088949  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0086-4  aI20  aJ13  aJ16  aJ24  aJ3110aEmployment Patterns of Less-Skilled Workers: Links to Children's Behavior and Academic Progress10aJohnson, Rucker C.10aKalil, Ariel10aDunifon, Rachel E.  aU CA, Berkeley  aU Chicago  aCornell U  aUsing data from five waves of the Women's Employment Survey (WES; 1997-2003), we examine the links between low-income mothers' employment patterns and the emotional behavior and academic progress of their children. We find robust and substantively important linkages between several different dimensions of mothers' employment experiences and child outcomes. The pattern of results is similar across empirical approaches--including ordinary least squares and child fixed-effect models, with and without an extensive set of controls. Children exhibit fewer behavior problems when mothers work and experience job stability (relative to children whose mothers do not work). In contrast, maternal work accompanied by job instability is associated with significantly higher child behavior problems (relative to employment in a stable job). Children whose mothers work full-time and/or have fluctuating work schedules also exhibit significantly higher levels of behavior problems. However, full-time work has negative consequences for children only when it is in jobs that do not require cognitive skills. Such negative consequences are completely offset when this work experience is in jobs that require the cognitive skills that lead to higher wage growth prospects. Finally, fluctuating work schedules and full-time work in non-cognitively demanding jobs are each strongly associated with the probability that the child will repeat a grade or be placed in special education. 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Education  a Mothers  a Skill  a Wage  a Women  aJournal Article  g49g2h747-72tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1295384&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201201982naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450080002231000018003037000024003211100015003457100009003605200688003696500066010576500065011236500041011886510009012296530017012386530016012556530013012716530009012846530010012936530011013036550020013147730028013348560006013628560198013689030018015661281219  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107424  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0068-6  aJ16  aJ31  aJ7110aExplaining the Motherhood Wage Penalty during the Early Occupational Career10aStaff, Jeremy10aMortimer, Jeylan T.  aPA State U  aU MN  aPrior research shows that mothers earn lower hourly wages than women without children, and that this maternal wage penalty cannot be fully explained by differences between mothers and other women in work experience and job characteristics.

Using longitudinal data for 486 women followed from ages 19 to 31 in the Minnesota Youth Development Study, we find that accumulated months not in the labor force and not enrolled in school explain the residual pay gap between mothers and other women. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71)  aU.S.  aHourly Wages  a Motherhood  a Mothers  a Pay  a Wage  a Women  aJournal Article  g49g1h1-21tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281219&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201202670naa  2200493   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450082002311000021003137000024003347000024003581100009003827100009003917100009004005201076004096500048014856500084015336500076016176500066016936510009017596530010017686530014017786530014017926530012018066530013018186530014018316530013018456530016018586530016018746530015018906550020019057730029019258560006019548560198019609030018021581281220  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107414  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0080-x  aI31  aJ12  aJ13  aJ1610aFamily Structure Transitions and Changes in Maternal Resources and Well-Being10aOsborne, Cynthia10aBerger, Lawrence M.10aMagnuson, Katherine  aU TX  aU WI  aU WI  aThis article uses data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to examine whether family instability is associated with changes in perceived social support, material hardship, maternal depression, and parenting stress among mothers of young children. In addition to accounting for the number of transitions that a mother experiences during the first five years of her child's life, we pay close attention to the type and timing of these transitions. We find that mothers who transition to cohabitation or marriage with their child's biological father experience declines in material hardship and that those who transition to cohabitation or marriage with another man exhibit modest declines in both material hardship and depression. Mothers who exit cohabiting or marital relationships encounter decreases in perceived social support and increases in material hardship, depression, and parenting stress. Overall, our results suggest that both the type and, to a much lesser degree, the timing of family structure transitions may influence maternal well-being. 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Families  a Family  a Marital  a Marriage  a Mothers  a Well Being  a Well-being  a Wellbeing  aJournal Article  g49g1h23-47tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281220&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201202935naa  2200493   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450067002231000019002907000021003097000021003307000028003517000021003791100015004007100015004157100015004307100015004457100015004605201351004756500084018266500076019106500064019866510009020506530010020596530014020696530018020836530014021016530012021156530019021276530012021466530012021586550020021707730029021908560006022198560198022259030018024231281221  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107415  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0081-9  aJ12  aJ13  aK4210aBeyond Absenteeism: Father Incarceration and Child Development10aGeller, Amanda10aCooper, Carey E.10aGarfinkel, Irwin20aSchwartz-Soicher, Ofira10aMincy, Ronald B.  aColumbia U  aAZ State U  aColumbia U  aColumbia U  aColumbia U  aHigh rates of incarceration among American men, coupled with high rates of fatherhood among men in prison, have motivated recent research on the effects of parental imprisonment on children's development. We use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to examine the relationship between paternal incarceration and developmental outcomes for approximately 3,000 urban children. We estimate cross-sectional and longitudinal regression models that control not only for fathers' basic demographic characteristics and a rich set of potential confounders, but also for several measures of pre-incarceration child development and family fixed effects. We find significant increases in aggressive behaviors and some evidence of increased attention problems among children whose fathers are incarcerated. The estimated effects of paternal incarceration are stronger than those of other forms of father absence, suggesting that children with incarcerated fathers may require specialized support from caretakers, teachers, and social service providers. The estimated effects are stronger for children who lived with their fathers prior to incarceration but are also significant for children of nonresident fathers, suggesting that incarceration places children at risk through family hardships including and beyond parent-child separation. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aIllegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law         b(K42)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Demographics  a Families  a Family  a Incarceration  a Parent  a Prison  aJournal Article  g49g1h49-76tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281221&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201203125naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002310430008002392450089002471000028003361100022003645201324003866500077017106500084017876500076018716500109019476500123020566500155021796510017023346530010023516530013023616530015023746530014023896530016024036550020024197730030024398560006024698560198024759030018026731281222  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107417  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0083-7  aJ11  aJ12  aJ13  aO15  aP23  aP3610aSkewed Sex Ratios at Birth and Future Marriage Squeeze in China and India, 2005-210010aGuilmoto, Christophe Z.  aIRD, CEPED, Paris  aI examine the potential impact of the anticipated future marriage squeeze on nuptiality patterns in China and India during the twenty-first century. I use population projections from 2005 to 2100 based on three different scenarios for the sex ratio at birth (SRB). To counteract the limitations of cross-sectional methods commonly used to assess the severity of marriage squeezes, I use a two-sex cohort-based procedure to simulate marriage patterns over the twenty-first century based on the female dominance model. I also examine two more-flexible marriage functions to illustrate the potential impact of changes in marriage schedules as a response to the marriage squeeze. Longitudinal indicators of marriage squeeze indicate that the number of prospective grooms in both countries will exceed that of prospective brides by more 50% for three decades in the most favorable scenario. Rates of male bachelorhood will not peak before 2050, and the squeeze conditions will be felt several decades thereafter, even among cohorts unaffected by adverse SRB. If the SRB is allowed to return to normalcy by 2020, the proportion of men unmarried at age 50 is expected to rise to 15% in China by 2055 and to 10% in India by 2065. India suffers from the additional impact of a delayed fertility transition on its age structures. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population         b(P23) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36)  aChina; India  aBirth  a Cohorts  a Fertility  a Marriage  a Population  aJournal Article  g49g1h77-100tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281222&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201202901naa  2200481   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450061002231000017002847000025003017000019003267000017003457000028003627000024003901100026004147100099004407100015005397100016005547100014005707100009005845201288005936500053018816500076019346500066020106510009020766530010020856530014020956530015021096530012021246530011021366550020021477730030021678560006021978560198022039030018024011281223  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107416  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0073-9  aC83  aJ13  aJ1613aThe Quality of Male Fertility Data in Major U.S. Surveys10aJoyner, Kara10aPeters, H.

To address these concerns, this study evaluates the quality of men's fertility data in the 1979 and 1997 cohorts of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79 and NLSY97) and in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Comparing fertility rates in each survey with population rates based on data from Vital Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau, we document how the incomplete reporting of births in different surveys varies according to men's characteristics, including their age, race, marital status, and birth cohort. In addition, we use Monte Carlo simulations based on the NSFG data to demonstrate how birth underreporting biases associations between early parenthood and its antecedents. We find that in the NSFG, roughly four out of five early births were reported; but in the NLSY79 and NLSY97, almost nine-tenths of early births were reported. In all three surveys, incomplete reporting was especially pronounced for nonmarital births. Our results suggest that the quality of male fertility data is strongly linked to survey design and that it has implications for models of early male fertility. 4aSurvey Methods; Sampling Methods         b(C83) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Children  a Fertility  a Survey  a Youth  aJournal Article  g49g1h101-24tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281223&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201202815naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450077002311000024003087000019003321100038003517100021003895201341004106500070017516500057018216500076018786500066019546510009020206530017020296530015020466530012020616530022020736530015020956530011021106550020021217730030021418560006021718560198021779030018023751281224  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107418  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0078-4  aG22  aI13  aJ13  aJ1610aUtilization of Infertility Treatments: The Effects of Insurance Mandates10aBitler, Marianne P.10aSchmidt, Lucie  aU CA, Irvine and RAND Corporation  aWilliams College  aOver the last several decades, both delay of childbearing and fertility problems have become increasingly common among women in developed countries. At the same time, technological changes have made many more options available to individuals experiencing fertility problems. However, these technologies are expensive, and only 25% of health insurance plans in the United States cover infertility treatment. As a result of these high costs, legislation has been passed in 15 states that mandates insurance coverage of infertility treatment in private insurance plans. In this article, we examine whether mandated insurance coverage for infertility treatment affects utilization. We allow utilization effects to differ by age and education, since previous research suggests that older, more-educated women should be more likely to be directly affected by the mandates than younger women and less-educated women, both because they are at higher risk of fertility problems and because they are more likely to have private health insurance, which is subject to the mandate. We find robust evidence that the mandates do have a significant effect on utilization for older, more-educated women that is larger than the effects found for other groups. These effects are largest for the use of ovulation-inducing drugs and artificial insemination. 4aInsurance; Insurance Companies; Actuarial Studies         b(G22) 4aHealth Insurance, Public and Private         b(I13) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aChildbearing  a Fertility  a Health  a Health Insurance  a Insurance  a Women  aJournal Article  g49g1h125-49tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281224&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201202283naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450133002311000028003641100027003925200751004196500076011706500066012466500033013126500109013456510009014546530010014636530014014736530026014876530015015136530012015286530015015406530013015556530021015686550020015897730030016098560006016398560198016459030018018431281225  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107410  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0076-6  aJ13  aJ16  aJ23  aO1510aCan We Still Learn Something from the Relationship between Fertility and Mother's Employment?

Using the event of multiple births as an instrumental variable (IV) for fertility, I find that having children has a negative impact on female employment. In addition, three types of heterogeneity are found. First, the magnitude of the impact depends on the birth at which the increase in fertility takes place. Second, the types of jobs affected by a fertility shock (multiple births) are jobs identified with a higher degree of informality, such as self-employment or unpaid jobs. Finally, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that an unexpected change in fertility is stronger at a higher education level of the mother and in urban areas. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aLabor Demand         b(J23) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aLDCs  aBirth  a Children  a Developing Countries  a Education  a Female  a Fertility  a Mothers  a Self Employment  aJournal Article  g49g1h151-74tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281225&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201202834naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450084002151000023002997000026003227000022003487000022003701100016003927100065004087100022004737100137004955201254006326500084018866500076019706510011020466530010020576530018020676530014020856530014020996530012021136530015021256550020021407730030021608560006021908560198021969030018023941281226  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107411  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0085-5  aJ12  aJ1310aUnion Instability as an Engine of Fertility?

At the same time, union instability produces a pool of persons who may enter new partnerships and have additional children in stepfamilies. The balance between these two opposing forces and their implications for fertility may depend on the timing of union formation and parenthood. In this article, we estimate models of childbearing, union formation, and union dissolution for female respondents to the 1999 French Etude de l'Histoire Familiale. Model parameters are applied in microsimulations of completed family size. We find that a population of women whose first unions dissolve during the childbearing years will end up with smaller families, on average, than a population in which all unions remain intact. Because new partnerships encourage higher parity progressions, repartnering minimizes the fertility gap between populations with and those without union dissolution. Differences between the two populations are much smaller when family formation is postponed--that is, when union formation and dissolution or first birth occurs after age 30, or when couples delay childbearing after union formation. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aFrance  aBirth  a Childbearing  a Children  a Families  a Family  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g49g1h175-95tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281226&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201202935naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450096002311000019003277000025003461100009003717100009003805201332003896500084017216500066018056500053018716500172019246510009020966530011021056530012021166530018021286530013021466530015021596530015021746530016021896530011022056550020022167730031022368560006022678560198022739030018024711281227  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107423  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0074-8  aJ12  aJ16  aJ22  aR2310aDifferent Reasons, Different Results: Implications of Migration by Gender and Family Status10aGeist, Claudia10aMcManus, Patricia A.  aU UT  aIN U  aPrevious research on migration and gendered career outcomes centers on couples and rarely examines the reason for the move. The implicit assumption is usually that households migrate in response to job opportunities. Based on a two-year panel from the Current Population Survey, this article uses stated reasons for geographic mobility to compare earnings outcomes among job migrants, family migrants, and quality-of-life migrants by gender and family status. We further assess the impact of migration on couples' internal household economy. The effects of job-related moves that we find are reduced substantially in the fixed-effects models, indicating strong selection effects. Married women who moved for family reasons experience significant and substantial earnings declines. Consistent with conventional models of migration, we find that household earnings and income and gender specialization increase following job migration. Married women who are secondary earners have increased odds of reducing their labor supply following migration for job or family reasons. However, we also find that migrating women who contributed as equals to the household economy before the move are no more likely than nonmigrant women to exit work or to work part-time. Equal breadwinner status may protect women from becoming tied movers. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aFamily  a Gender  a Labor Supply  a Migrant  a Migration  a Part Time  a Population  a Women  aJournal Article  g49g1h197-217tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281227&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201201903naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450048002231000025002717000020002961100009003167100009003255200675003346500083010096500065010926500065011576510009012226530014012316530014012456530010012596550020012697730030012898560006013198560198013259030018015231281228  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107419  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0079-3  aJ24  aJ31  aJ6113aThe Value of an Employment-Based Green Card10aMukhopadhyay, Sankar10aOxborrow, David  aU NV  aU NV  aThe need for and role of highly skilled immigrant workers in the U.S. economy is fiercely debated. Proponents and opponents agree that temporary foreign workers are paid a lower wage than are natives. This lower wage partly originates from the restricted mobility of workers while on a temporary visa. In this article, we estimate the wage gain to employment-based immigrants from acquiring permanent U.S. residency. We use data from the New Immigrant Survey (2003) and implement a difference-in-difference propensity score matching estimator. We find that for employer-sponsored immigrants, the acquisition of a green card leads to an annual wage gain of about $11,860. 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  a Mobility  a Wage  aJournal Article  g49g1h219-37tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281228&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201202511naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450059002311000022002901100013003125201071003256500038013966500084014346500109015186500172016276510011017996530014018106530013018246530013018376530015018506550020018657730030018858560006019158560198019219030018021191281229  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107422  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0072-x  aI12  aJ12  aO15  aR2310aMigration, Marital Change, and HIV Infection in Malawi10aAnglewicz, Philip  aTulane U  aResearch on the relationship between migration and HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa often suggests that migrants are at higher risk of HIV infection because they are more likely to engage in HIV risk behaviors than nonmigrants, and they tend to move to areas with a relatively higher HIV prevalence. Although migration may be a risk factor for HIV infection, I instead focus on the possibility that the HIV positive are more likely to migrate. Using a longitudinal data set of permanent rural residents and migrants from Malawi, I find that migrants originating from rural areas are indeed more likely than nonmigrants to be HIV positive and to have engaged in HIV risk behaviors. The increased HIV risk among migrants may be due to the selection of HIV-positive individuals into migration; I find that HIV-positive individuals are more likely to migrate than those who are HIV negative. The explanation for this phenomenon appears to be marital instability, which occurs more frequently among HIV-positive individuals and leads to migration after marital change. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aMalawi  aInfection  a Marital  a Migrant  a Migration  aJournal Article  g49g1h239-65tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281229&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201203119naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450158002231000021003817000020004027000021004221100087004437100086005307100087006165201544007036500038022476500108022856500068023936510009024616530015024706550020024857730030025058560006025358560198025419030018027391281230  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107421  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0071-y  aI12  aJ14  aJ2110aOut of Sight, Out of Mind: Including Group Quarters Residents with Household Residents Can Change What We Know about Working-Age People with Disabilities10aStapleton, David10aHoneycutt, Todd10aSchechter, Bruce  aCenter for Studying Disability Policy, Mathematica Policy Research, Washington, DC  aCenter for Studying Disability Policy, Mathematica Policy Research, Princeton, NJ  aCenter for Studying Disability Policy, Mathematica Policy Research, Washington, DC  aInformation about residents of institutional and noninstitutional group quarters (GQ), particularly those with disabilities, has been limited by gaps in survey data, and statistics based on data that exclude some or all GQ residents are biased as estimates of total population statistics.

A three-group model best fits the data for both males and females. For most groups, predicted numbers of limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) increase with age, but the pace is gradual in some cases and rapid in others. For each gender, the estimated mortality probability trajectories for the three groups follow a hierarchy that is related to the predicted ADL counts at age 80. Only a few characteristics predict trajectory-group membership. Prior nonagricultural occupation is associated with less favorable disability trajectories for both genders. For females, rural residence, a greater number of children ever born, and having a father who did not work in agriculture are associated with more favorable trajectories. For a small group of males who received education, disability is moderate but changes little with age. Findings may reflect heterogeneity of survival among the least advantaged, as well as a possible expansion of morbidity among a small advantaged group. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Urban, Rural, and Regional Economics         b(P25) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aChina  aDemographics  a Disability  a Education  a Female  a Gender  a Morbidity  a Mortality  a Population  aJournal Article  g49g1h291-314tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281231&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201202659naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450110002151000027003257000022003527000021003741100061003957100037004567100037004935201342005306500038018726500065019106510009019756530014019846530015019986530012020136550020020257730030020458560006020758560198020819030018022791281232  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107413  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0082-8  aI12  aI2010aEducational Attainment and Adult Mortality in the United States: A Systematic Analysis of Functional Form10aMontez, Jennifer Karas10aHummer, Robert A.10aHayward, Mark D.  aCenter for Population and Development Studies, Harvard U  aPopulation Research Center, U TX  aPopulation Research Center, U TX  aA vast literature has documented the inverse association between educational attainment and U.S. adult mortality risk but given little attention to identifying the optimal functional form of the association. A theoretical explanation of the association hinges on our ability to describe it empirically. Using the 1979-1998 National Longitudinal Mortality Study for non-Hispanic white and black adults aged 25-100 years during the mortality follow-up period (N = 1,008,215), we evaluated 13 functional forms across race-gender-age subgroups to determine which form(s) best captured the association. Results revealed that the preferred functional form includes a linear decline in mortality risk from 0 to 11 years of education, followed by a step-change reduction in mortality risk upon attainment of a high school diploma, at which point mortality risk resumes a linear decline but with a steeper slope than that prior to a high school diploma. The findings provide important clues for theoretical development of explanatory mechanisms: an explanation for the selected functional form may require integrating a credentialist perspective to explain the step-change reduction in mortality risk upon attainment of a high school diploma, with a human capital perspective to explain the linear declines before and after a high school diploma. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20)  aU.S.  aEducation  a Mortality  a School  aJournal Article  g49g1h315-36tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281232&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201202547naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002312450112002391000026003511100009003775200986003866500065013726500045014376500113014826500083015956500109016786510011017876530014017986530016018126530010018286530012018386530015018506550020018657730030018858560006019158560198019219030018021191281233  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107409  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0084-6  aI20  aI24  aJ15  aJ24  aO1510aEducational Inequality by Race in Brazil, 1982-2007: Structural Changes and Shifts in Racial Classification10aMarteleto, Leticia J.  aU TX  aDespite overwhelming improvements in educational levels and opportunity during the past three decades, educational disadvantages associated with race still persist in Brazil. Using the nationally representative Pesquisa Nacional de Amostra por Domicilio (PNAD) data from 1982 and 1987 to 2007, this study investigates educational inequalities between white, pardo (mixed-race), and black Brazilians over the 25-year period. Although the educational advantage of whites persisted during this period, I find that the significance of race as it relates to education changed. By 2007, those identified as blacks and pardos became more similar in their schooling levels, whereas in the past, blacks had greater disadvantages. I test two possible explanations for this shift: structural changes and shifts in racial classification. I find evidence for both. I discuss the findings in light of the recent race-based affirmative action policies being implemented in Brazilian universities. 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aEducation and Inequality         b(I24) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBrazil  aEducation  a Inequality  a Race  a Racial  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g49g1h337-58tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281233&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201202802naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002312450028002391000017002677000018002841100015003027100015003175201373003326500070017056500055017756500038018306500056018686500117019246530011020416530016020526530012020686530015020806530013020956550020021087730030021288560006021588560198021649030018023621281234  a201202       201202                        eng     aEP71107420  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0077-5  aC43  aD14  aI12  aI32  aI3811aAssessing Asset Indices10aFilmer, Deon10aScott, Kinnon  aWorld Bank  aWorld Bank  aThe use of asset indices in welfare analysis and poverty targeting is increasing, especially in cases in which data on expenditures are unavailable or hard to collect. We compare alternative approaches to welfare measurement. Our analysis shows that inferences about inequalities in education, health care use, fertility, and child mortality, as well as labor market outcomes, are quite robust to the economic status measure used. Different measures--most significantly per capita expenditures versus the class of asset indices--do not, however, yield identical household rankings. Two factors stand out in predicting the degree of congruence in rankings. First is the extent to which expenditures can be explained by observed household and community characteristics. Rankings are most similar in settings with small transitory shocks to expenditure or with little random measurement error in expenditure. Second is the extent to which expenditures are dominated by individually consumed goods, such as food. Asset indices are typically derived from indicators of goods that are effectively public at the household level, while expenditures are often dominated by food, an almost exclusively private good. In settings in which individually consumed goods are the main component of expenditures, asset indices and per capita consumption yield the least similar results. 4aIndex Numbers and Aggregation; Leading indicators         b(C43) 4aHousehold Saving; Personal Finance         b(D14) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38)  aHealth  a Indicators  a Indice  a Mortality  a Welfare  aJournal Article  g49g1h359-92tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1281234&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201202209naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001992450107002071000015003141100009003295201199003386500077015376510011016146530017016256530016016426550020016587730031016788560006017098560198017159030018019131275971  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480776  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0070-z  aJ1110aHow the World Survived the Population Bomb: Lessons from 50 Years of Extraordinary Demographic History10aLam, David  aU MI  aThe world population will reach 7 billion in late 2011, a demographic milestone that is causing renewed attention to the challenges caused by population growth. This article looks at the last 50 years of demographic change, one of the most extraordinary periods in demographic history. During this period, world population grew at rates that have never been seen before and will almost surely never be seen again. There were many concerns about the potential impact of rapid population growth in the 1960s, including mass starvation in countries such as India, depletion of nonrenewable resources, and increased poverty in low-income countries. The actual experience was very different. World food production increased faster than world population in every decade since the 1960s, resource prices fell during most of the period, and poverty declined significantly in much of the developing world. The article considers the economic and demographic explanations for the surprising successes of this important period in demographic history. It also looks at regions that have been less successful, especially Africa, and at the lessons for dealing with the important challenges that still remain. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aGlobal  aDemographics  a Population  aJournal Article  g48g4h1231-62tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275971&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201102804naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450128002151000020003437000018003637000017003811100019003987100009004177100009004265201425004356500113018606500172019736510009021456530015021546530012021696550020021817730031022018560006022328560198022389030018024361275972  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480784  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0062-z  aJ15  aR2310aMetropolitan Structure and Neighborhood Attainment: Exploring Intermetropolitan Variation in Racial Residential Segregation10aSouth, Scott J.10aCrowder, Kyle10aPais, Jeremy  aU Albany, SUNY  aU WA  aU CT  aUsing data from the 1981, 1991, and 2001 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and several decennial censuses, we examine how characteristics of metropolitan areas are associated with black and white households' neighborhood racial composition. Results from hierarchical linear models show that about 20% to 40% of the variation in the percentage of households' tract population that is non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black exists across metropolitan areas. Over time, white households' exposure to non-Hispanic white neighbors has declined, and their exposure to non-Hispanic black neighbors has increased; the reverse trends are observed for blacks. These trends cannot be attributed to changes in the ecological structure of metropolitan areas. Blacks have fewer white neighbors in large metropolitan areas containing sizable minority populations, and blacks have more white neighbors in metropolitan areas with high government employment. Whites have more black neighbors in metropolitan areas with high levels of government employment and ample new housing; whites have fewer black neighbors in metropolitan areas with a high level of municipal fragmentation. The association between metropolitan-area percentage black and tract percentage black is weaker among whites than among blacks, suggesting that whites are especially motivated to self-segregate in metropolitan areas with large black populations. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aPopulation  a Racial  aJournal Article  g48g4h1263-92tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275972&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201102473naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450051002311000012002827000020002941100009003147100009003235201040003326500113013726500065014856500065015506500172016156510009017876530013017966530015018096550020018247730033018448560006018778560198018839030018020811275973  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480785  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0058-8  aJ15  aJ31  aJ61  aR2310aEthnic Enclaves and the Earnings of Immigrants10aXie, Yu10aGough, Margaret  aU MI  aU MI  aA large literature in sociology concerns the implications of immigrants' participation in ethnic enclaves for their economic and social well-being. The "enclave thesis" speculates that immigrants benefit from working in ethnic enclaves. Previous research concerning the effects of enclave participation on immigrants' economic outcomes has come to mixed conclusions as to whether enclave effects are positive or negative. In this article, we seek to extend and improve upon past work by formulating testable hypotheses based on the enclave thesis and testing them with data from the 2003 New Immigrant Survey (NIS), employing both residence-based and workplace-based measures of the ethnic enclave. We compare the economic outcomes of immigrants working in ethnic enclaves with those of immigrants working in the mainstream economy. Our research yields minimal support for the enclave thesis. Our results further indicate that for some immigrant groups, ethnic enclave participation actually has a negative effect on economic outcomes. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aEarnings  a Immigrant  aJournal Article  g48g4h1293-1315tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275973&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201103221naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002312450132002391000025003711100014003965201533004106500038019436500052019816500069020336500166021026500163022686510009024316530011024406530012024516530013024636530015024766530019024916530016025106550020025267730031025468560006025778560198025839030018027811275974  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480778  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0065-9  aI12  aJ26  aK10  aN31  aN3210aDo Not Go Gentle into That Good Night: The Effect of Retirement on Subsequent Mortality of US Supreme Court Justices, 1801-200610aStolzenberg, Ross M.  aU Chicago  aMortality hazard and length of time until death are widely used as health outcome measures and are themselves of fundamental demographic interest. Considerable research has asked whether labor force retirement reduces subsequent health and its mortality measures. Previous studies have reported positive, negative, and null effects of retirement on subsequent longevity and mortality hazard, but inconsistent findings are difficult to resolve because (1) nearly all data confound retirement with unemployment of older workers, and often, (2) endogeneity bias is rarely addressed analytically. To avoid these problems, albeit at loss of generalizability to the entire labor force, I examine data from an exceptional subgroup that is of interest in its own right: U.S. Supreme Court justices of 1801-2006. Using discrete-time event history methods, I estimate retirement effects on mortality hazard and years-left-alive. Some substantive and methodological considerations suggest models that specify endogenous effects estimated by instrumental variables (IV) probit, IV Tobit, and IV regression methods. Other considerations suggest estimation by endogenous switching (ES) probit and ES regression. Estimates by all these methods are consistent with the hypothesis that, on average, retirement decreases health, as indicated by elevated mortality hazard and diminished years-left-alive. These findings may apply to other occupational groups characterized by high levels of work autonomy, job satisfaction, and financial security. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aRetirement; Retirement Policies         b(J26) 4aBasic Areas of Law: General (Constitutional Law)         b(K10) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Health  a History  a Mortality  a Older Workers  a Retirement  aJournal Article  g48g4h1317-46tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275974&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201101872naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450103002151000021003181100009003395200804003486500038011526500042011906510012012326530011012446530015012556530015012706550020012857730031013058560006013368560198013429030018015401275975  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480790  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0052-1  aI12  aI2110aDoes More Schooling Reduce Hospitalization and Delay Mortality? New Evidence Based on Danish Twins10aBehrman, Jere R.  aU PA  aSchooling generally is positively associated with better health-related outcomes--for example, less hospitalization and later mortality--but these associations do not measure whether schooling causes better health-related outcomes. Schooling may in part be a proxy for unobserved endowments--including family background and genetics--that both are correlated with schooling and have direct causal effects on these outcomes. This study addresses the schooling-health-gradient issue with twins methodology, using rich data from the Danish Twin Registry linked to population-based registries to minimize random and systematic measurement error biases. We find strong, significantly negative associations between schooling and hospitalization and mortality, but generally no causal effects of schooling. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21)  aDenmark  aHealth  a Mortality  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g48g4h1347-75tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275975&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201102486naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001992450115002071000023003227000022003451100038003677100078004055201395004836500038018786510017019166550020019337730033019538560006019868560198019929030018021901275976  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480775  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0066-8  aI1210aDifferential Survival in Europe and the United States: Estimates Based on Subjective Probabilities of Survival10aDelavande, Adeline10aRohwedder, Susann  aRAND Corporation and New U Lisbon  aRAND Center for the Study of Aging, Santa Monica, CA and NETSPAR, Tilburg  aCross-country comparisons of differential survival by socioeconomic status (SES) are useful in many domains. Yet, to date, such studies have been rare. Reliably estimating differential survival in a single country has been challenging because it requires rich panel data with a large sample size. Cross-country estimates have proven even more difficult because the measures of SES need to be comparable internationally. We present an alternative method for acquiring information on differential survival by SES. Rather than using observations of actual survival, we relate individuals' subjective probabilities of survival to SES variables in cross section. To show that subjective survival probabilities are informative proxies for actual survival when estimating differential survival, we compare estimates of differential survival based on actual survival with estimates based on subjective probabilities of survival for the same sample. The results are remarkably similar. We then use this approach to compare differential survival by SES for 10 European countries and the United States. Wealthier people have higher survival probabilities than those who are less wealthy, but the strength of the association differs across countries. Nations with a smaller gradient appear to be Belgium, France, and Italy, while the United States, England, and Sweden appear to have a larger gradient. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aEurope; U.S.  aJournal Article  g48g4h1377-1400tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275976&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201102226naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450039002311000024002701100019002945200878003136500038011916500084012296500066013136500109013796510017014886530009015056530014015146530015015286530013015436530011015566550020015677730031015878560006016188560198016249030018018221275977  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480782  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0060-1  aI12  aJ12  aJ16  aO1510aMarital Shopping and Epidemic AIDS10aMagruder, Jeremy R.  aU CA, Berkeley  aHIV risks decline sharply at age 30 for women in South Africa, long before coital frequencies or pregnancies decrease. I evaluate several prominent behavioral models of HIV, and find that these do not suggest sharply decreasing risks with age. I formulate a model of spousal search and find that "marital shopping" can generate epidemic HIV prevalence despite low transmission rates because search behavior interacts with dynamics of HIV infectiousness. The implied age-infection profile closely mimics that in South Africa, and the suggested behavior matches that reported by South Africans. Condom use in new relationships and transmission rate reductions are both found to be effective policies and, when used together, eliminate the potential of spousal search to spread HIV. In contrast, antiretroviral treatment is found to have only a minimal effect on the epidemic. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSouth Africa  aAIDS  a Epidemic  a Infection  a Marital  a Women  aJournal Article  g48g4h1401-28tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275977&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201102172naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450095002231000023003187000020003411100042003617100011004035200816004146500038012306500113012686500066013816510009014476530009014566530012014656530012014776530013014896530011015026550020015137730031015338560006015648560198015709030018017681275978  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480779  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0064-x  aI12  aJ15  aJ1610aExplaining the Female Black-White Obesity Gap: A Decomposition Analysis of Proximal Causes10aJohnston, David W.10aLee, Wang-Sheng  aCentre for Health Economics, Monash U  aRMIT U  aThere exist remarkably large differences in body weights and obesity prevalence between black and white women in the United States; and crucially, these differences are a significant contributor to black-white inequalities in health. In this article, we investigate the most proximal explanations for the weight gap: namely, differences in diet and exercise. More specifically, we decompose black-white differences in body mass index and waist-to-height ratio into components reflecting black-white differences in energy intake and energy expenditure. The analysis indicates that overconsumption is much more important than a lack of exercise in explaining the weight gap, which suggests that diet interventions will have to play a fundamental role if the weight gap between black and white women is to decline. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aDiet  a Female  a Health  a Obesity  a Women  aJournal Article  g48g4h1429-50tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275978&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201102122naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450105002151000022003207000022003421100009003647100009003735200937003826500038013196500076013576510009014336530015014426530019014576530012014766530011014886550020014997730031015198560006015508560198015569030018017541275979  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480781  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0061-0  aI12  aJ1310aContraceptive Method Choice among Youth in the United States: The Importance of Relationship Context10aKusunoki, Yasamin10aUpchurch, Dawn M.  aU MI  aUCLA  aWe examine the relationship characteristics associated with contraceptive method choice within young people's nonmarital sexual relationships, using data from retrospective relationship histories available in the third wave (2001-2002) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.

We then use multilevel analysis to estimate associations between two key relationship characteristics--relationship commitment and couple heterogamy--and the type of contraceptive method used at last sexual intercourse within each relationship. Results indicate that for a given individual, contraceptive method choice varies across relationships as a function of these characteristics, even after we account for important individual and family characteristics and prior relationship experiences. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAdolescent  a Contraceptive  a Health  a Youth  aJournal Article  g48g4h1451-72tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275979&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201102123naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450085002231000022003081100008003305200983003386500081013216500038014026500066014406530015015066530015015216550020015367730031015568560006015878560198015939030018017911275980  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480783  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0054-z  aD91  aI12  aJ1613aThe Effect of Maternal Stress on Birth Outcomes: Exploiting a Natural Experiment10aTorche, Florencia  aNYU  aA growing body of research highlights that in utero conditions are consequential for individual outcomes throughout the life cycle, but research assessing causal processes is scarce. This article examines the effect of one such condition--prenatal maternal stress--on birth weight, an early outcome shown to affect cognitive, educational, and socioeconomic attainment later in life. Exploiting a major earthquake as a source of acute stress and using a difference-in-difference methodology, I find that maternal exposure to stress results in a significant decline in birth weight and an increase in the proportion of low birth weight. This effect is focused on the first trimester of gestation, and it is mediated by reduced gestational age rather than by factors affecting the intrauterine growth of term infants. The findings highlight the relevance of understanding the early emergence of unequal outcomes and of investing in maternal well-being since the onset of pregnancy. 4aIntertemporal Household Choice; Life Cycle Models and Saving         b(D91) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aLife Cycle  a Pregnancy  aJournal Article  g48g4h1473-91tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275980&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201102124naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450050002151000026002657000019002911100026003107100015003365200918003516500076012696500066013456510009014116530010014206530018014306530015014486530013014636530011014766550020014877730033015078560006015408560198015469030018017441275981  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480789  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0059-7  aJ13  aJ1610aFertility Following an Unintended First Birth10aGuzzo, Karen Benjamin10aHayford, Sarah  aBowling Green State U  aAZ State U  aResearch on unintended fertility tends to focus on births as isolated events. This article expands previous research by examining the relationship between early unintended childbearing and subsequent fertility dynamics in the United States. Data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth show that 27.5% of mothers report an unintended first birth. We use event history methods to show that these women are significantly more likely than women with an intended first birth to have an unintended second birth than to have either no second birth or an intended second birth, net of sociodemographic characteristics. An unintended first birth also increases the risk of having an unintended third birth relative to no birth or an intended birth, independent of the intendedness of the second birth. We conclude that early unintended fertility is a strong signal of high risk for subsequent unintended fertility. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Childbearing  a Fertility  a Mothers  a Women  aJournal Article  g48g4h1493-1516tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275981&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201102291naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450071002151000023002867000022003097000020003317000021003517000021003727000021003931100009004147100009004237100009004327100015004417100065004567100076005215200876005976500038014736500073015116530011015846530013015956550020016087730031016288560006016598560198016659030018018631275982  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480788  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0057-9  aI12  aI1810aPopulation Composition, Public Policy, and the Genetics of Smoking10aBoardman, Jason D.10aBlalock, Casey L.10aPampel, Fred C.10aHatemi, Peter K.10aHeath, Andrew C.10aEaves, Lindon J.  aU CO  aU CO  aU CO  aPA State U  aMidwest Alcoholism Research Center, Washington U in St Louis  aVA Institute for Polytechnic and Behavioral Genetics, VA Commonwealth U  aIn this article, we explore the effect of public policy on the extent to which genes influence smoking desistance. Using a sample of adult twins (n mz = 363, n dz = 233) from a large population registry, we estimate Cox proportional hazards models that describe similarity in the timing of smoking desistance among adult twin pairs. We show that identical twin pairs are significantly more likely to quit smoking within a similar time frame compared with fraternal twin pairs. Importantly, we then show that genetic factors for smoking desistance increase in importance following restrictive legislation on smoking behaviors that occurred in the early and mid-1970s. These findings support the social push perspective and make important contributions to the social demography and genetic epidemiology of smoking as well as to the gene-environment interaction literatures. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18)  aPolicy  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g48g4h1517-33tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275982&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201102991naa  2200457   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002310430008002392450141002471000016003887000016004047000018004201100015004387100024004537100024004775201070005016500076015716500113016476500066017606500109018266500123019356500155020586510010022136530010022236530011022336530016022446550020022607730031022808560006023118560198023179030018025151275983  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480786  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0055-y  aJ13  aJ15  aJ16  aO15  aP23  aP3610aEstimating the Effect of the One-Child Policy on the Sex Ratio Imbalance in China: Identification Based on the Difference-in-Differences10aLi, Hongbin10aYi, Junjian10aZhang, Junsen  aTsinghua U  aChinese U Hong Kong  aChinese U Hong Kong  aIn China, the male-biased sex ratio has increased significantly. Because the one-child policy applies only to the Han Chinese but not to minorities, this unique affirmative policy allows us to identify the causal effect of the one-child policy on the increase in sex ratios by using a difference-in-differences (DD) estimator. Using the 1990 census, we find that the strict enforcement of the one-child policy led to 4.4 extra boys per 100 girls in the 1980s, accounting for about 94% of the total increase in sex ratios during this period. The robust tests indicate that the estimated policy effect is not likely confounded by other omitted policy shocks or socioeconomic changes. Moreover, we conduct the DD estimation using both the 2000 census and the 2005 mini-census. Our estimates suggest that the one-child policy resulted in about 7.0 extra boys per 100 girls for the 1991-2005 birth cohorts. The effect of the one-child policy accounts for about 57% and 54% of the total increases in sex ratios for the 1991-2000 and 2001-2005 birth cohorts, respectively. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population         b(P23) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36)  aChina  aBirth  a Child  a Minorities  aJournal Article  g48g4h1535-57tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275983&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201102680naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450088002151000018003037000024003211100013003457100018003585201437003766500084018136500076018976510010019736530010019836530014019936530014020076530012020216530012020336550020020457730031020658560006020968560198021029030018023001275984  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480791  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0053-0  aJ12  aJ1310aPurchasing Piety?

We focused on how needs and resources in each generation are associated with whether married couples live with their parents in parent-headed and child-headed households, and we also investigated difference in power relations between older and younger generations and between children and their spouses. We analyzed a nationally representative sample of older parents (n = 3,853) and their married children (n = 8,601) from the 1999 Nihon University Japanese Longitudinal Study of Aging (NUJLSOA). Mutinomial regression revealed that married children with relatively affluent parents tended to live with them in parent-headed households and that married children with parents who are in relatively poor health or who are widowed tended to live with them in child-headed households. We also found that less-educated married children tended to live in the households of their higher-income parents, suggesting that parents may be "purchasing" traditional arrangements with less-affluent children. In addition, children with an educational advantage over their spouses were more likely to have parents living with them in child-headed coresident households. We conclude that traditional multigenerational coresidence has become a commodity negotiated within families based on relative resources and needs within and across generations. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aJapan  aChild  a Children  a Families  a Parent  a Spouse  aJournal Article  g48g4h1559-79tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275984&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201102223naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450048002151000026002637000023002897000020003121100016003327100016003487100016003645200980003806500077013606500076014376510023015136530021015366530015015576530016015726550020015887730031016088560006016398560198016459030018018431275985  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480780  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0063-y  aJ11  aJ1310aOn Nonstable and Stable Population Momentum10aEspenshade, Thomas J.10aOlgiati, Analia S.10aLevin, Simon A.  aPrinceton U  aPrinceton U  aPrinceton U  aThis article decomposes total population momentum into two constituent and multiplicative parts: "nonstable" momentum and "stable" momentum. Nonstable momentum depends on deviations between a population's current age distribution and its implied stable age distribution. Stable momentum is a function of deviations between a population's implied stable and stationary age distributions. In general, the factorization of total momentum into the product of nonstable and stable momentum is a very good approximation. The factorization is exact, however, when the current age distribution is stable or when observed fertility is already at replacement. We provide numerical illustrations by calculating nonstable, stable, and total momentum for 176 countries, the world, and its major regions. In short, the article brings together disparate strands of the population momentum literature and shows how the various kinds of momentum fit together into a single unifying framework. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aSelected Countries  aAge Distribution  a Fertility  a Population  aJournal Article  g48g4h1581-99tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275985&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201102591naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450107002231000022003307000025003521100049003777100009004265201179004356500117016146500113017316500066018446510009019106530015019196530012019346530010019466550020019567730031019768560006020078560198020139030018022111275986  a201201       201111                        eng     aEP67480787  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0056-x  aI38  aJ15  aJ1610aWho Receives Food Stamps during Adulthood? Analyzing Repeatable Events with Incomplete Event Histories10aGrieger, Lloyd D.10aDanziger, Sheldon H.  aJackson Institute for Global Affairs, Yale U  aU MI  aUsing data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) from 1968 to 2005, we estimate the cumulative probability that young adults in the United States will receive food stamps during adulthood, and examine how that probability varies with an individual's income and education at age 25 as well as by race and gender. We find that the probability of first food stamp receipt as an adult declines sharply with age, indicating that most adult recipients do so by age 40. Also, those receiving food stamps in early adulthood are likely to receive them again. For these reasons, and because food stamp receipt is a repeatable event, life table analyses that include individuals who are not observed until after they become exposed to the risk of food stamp receipt (whom we label "late entrants") are likely to overstate cumulative participation during adulthood. For example, one often-cited study included individuals who enter their sample after age 20 (late entrants) and report that 50.8% of 20-year-olds are recipients by age 65. In contrast, when we exclude late entrants, we find that 39.2% of 20-year-olds and 29.7% of 25-year-olds receive benefits during adulthood. 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aFood Stamp  a Gender  a Race  aJournal Article  g48g4h1601-14tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275986&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201100518naa  2200145   4500001001100000008004400011022001300055037003000068245003300098655001200131773001000143856000600153856020100159903001200360EP67480777       201111                        eng     a00703370  n10.1007/s13524-011-0067-711aAcknowledgment of Reviewers.  aArticle  g48g4  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=EP67480777&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNov201100506naa  2200145   4500001001100000008004400011022001300055037003000068245002100098655001200119773001000131856000600141856020100147903001200348EP67480774       201111                        eng     a00703370  n10.1007/s13524-011-0069-510aVolume 48 Index.  aArticle  g48g4  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=EP67480774&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNov201102295naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450076002151000021002911100025003125201192003376500077015296500076016066510011016826530014016936530016017076550020017237730030017438560006017738560198017799030016019771253543  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909903  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0040-5  aJ11  aJ1310aProbabilistic Projections of the Total Fertility Rate for All Countries10aAlkema, Leontine  aNational U Singapore  aWe describe a Bayesian projection model to produce country-specific projections of the total fertility rate (TFR) for all countries. The model decomposes the evolution of TFR into three phases: pre-transition high fertility, the fertility transition, and post-transition low fertility. The model for the fertility decline builds on the United Nations Population Division's current deterministic projection methodology, which assumes that fertility will eventually fall below replacement level. It models the decline in TFR as the sum of two logistic functions that depend on the current TFR level, and a random term. A Bayesian hierarchical model is used to project future TFR based on both the country's TFR history and the pattern of all countries. It is estimated from United Nations estimates of past TFR in all countries using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The post-transition low fertility phase is modeled using an autoregressive model, in which long-term TFR projections converge toward and oscillate around replacement level. The method is evaluated using out-of-sample projections for the period since 1980 and the period since 1995, and is found to be well calibrated. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aGlobal  aFertility  a Population  aJournal Article  g48g3h815-39tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253543&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102128naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001992450022002071000025002291100018002545201242002726500076015146530014015906550020016047730030016248560006016548560198016609030016018581253544  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909917  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0033-4  aJ1310aTempo and the TFR10aNi Bhrolchain, Maire  aU Southampton  aTempo effects in period fertility indicators are widely regarded as a source of bias or distortion. But is this always the case? Whether tempo change results in bias depends, in the view advanced here, on the measure used, the meaning of bias/distortion, and the objective of analysis. Two ways of construing bias in period measures are suggested, and their relevance is discussed in the context of five broad purposes for measuring period fertility: describing and explaining fertility time trends, anticipating future prospects, providing input parameters for formal models, and communicating with nonspecialist audiences. Genuine timing effects are not biasing when period fertility is the explanandum but are distorting when the aim is to estimate cohort fertility. Alternatives to tempo adjustment are available that are a more defensible solution to the issue of timing change. Tempo adjustment could be more fruitfully considered a form of modeling rather than empirical measurement. The measurement of period fertility could be improved by relying more on a statistical approach and less on indicators based on stable assumptions. Future progress will depend on integrating research on measurement with substantive investigation. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aFertility  aJournal Article  g48g3h841-61tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253544&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102420naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450085002231000021003087000018003291100009003477100009003565201149003656500060015146500076015746500066016506510009017166530014017256530015017396530011017546530011017656550020017767730030017968560006018268560198018329030016020301253545  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909905  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0034-3  aI23  aJ13  aJ1613aThe Impact of College Education on Fertility: Evidence for Heterogeneous Effects10aBrand, Jennie E.10aDavis, Dwight  aUCLA  aUCLA  aAs college-going among women has increased, more women are going to college from backgrounds that previously would have precluded their attendance and completion. This affords us the opportunity and motivation to look at the effects of college on fertility across a range of social backgrounds and levels of early achievement. Despite a substantial literature on the effects of education on women's fertility, researchers have not assessed variation in effects by selection into college. With data on U.S. women from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, we examine effects of timely college attendance and completion on women's fertility by the propensity to attend and complete college using multilevel Poisson and discrete-time event-history models. Disaggregating the effects of college by propensity score strata, we find that the fertility-decreasing college effect is concentrated among women from comparatively disadvantaged social backgrounds and low levels of early achievement. The effects of college on fertility attenuate as we observe women from backgrounds that are more predictive of college attendance and completion. 4aHigher Education; Research Institutions         b(I23) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aEducation  a Fertility  a Women  a Youth  aJournal Article  g48g3h863-87tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253545&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102549naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450093002231000019003167000023003357000022003587000015003801100015003957100009004107100015004197100023004345201105004576500060015626500113016226500066017356510009018016530011018106530012018216530012018336530011018456550020018567730031018768560006019078560198019139030016021111253546  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909918  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0037-0  aI23  aJ15  aJ1613aThe Black Gender Gap in Educational Attainment: Historical Trends and Racial Comparisons10aMcDaniel, Anne10aDiPrete, Thomas A.10aBuchmann, Claudia10aShwed, Uri  aOH State U  aU WI  aOH State U  aBen-Gurion U Negev  aIt is often asserted that the gender gap in educational attainment is larger for blacks than whites, but historical trends comparing the black and white gender gap have received surprisingly little attention. Analysis of historical data from the U.S. census IPUMS samples shows that the gender gap in college completion has evolved differently for whites and blacks. Historically, the female advantage in educational attainment among blacks is linked to more favorable labor market opportunities and stronger incentives for employment for educated black women. Blacks, particularly black males, still lag far behind whites in their rates of college completion, but the striking educational gains of white women have caused the racial patterns of gender differences in college completion rates to grow more similar over time. While some have linked the disadvantaged position of black males to their high risk of incarceration, our estimates suggest that incarceration has a relatively small impact on the black gender gap and the racial gap in college completion rates for males in the United States. 4aHigher Education; Research Institutions         b(I23) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aFemale  a Gender  a Racial  a Women  aJournal Article  g48g3h889-914tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253546&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102638naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450127002231000019003501100061003695201240004306500065016706500066017356500109018016510029019106530017019396530015019566530012019716530012019836530011019956550020020067730030020268560006020568560198020629030016022601253547  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909907  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0048-x  aI20  aJ16  aO1510aEducation and Male-Female Differences in Later-Life Cognition: International Evidence from Latin America and the Caribbean10aMaurer, Jurgen  aInstitute of Health Economics and Management, U Lausanne  aThis study explores the role of early-life education for differences in cognitive functioning between men and women aged 60 and older from seven major urban areas in Latin America and the Caribbean. After documenting statistically significant differences in cognitive functioning between men and women for six of the seven study sites, I assess the extent to which these differences can be explained by prevailing male-female differences in education. I decompose predicted male-female differences in cognitive functioning based on various statistical models for later-life cognition and find robust evidence that male-female differences in education are a major driving force behind cognitive functioning differences between older men and women. This study therefore suggests that early-life differences in educational attainment between boys and girls during childhood have a lasting impact on gender inequity in cognitive functioning at older ages. Increases in educational attainment and the closing of the gender gap in education in many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean may thus result in both higher levels and a more gender-equitable distribution of later-life cognition among the future elderly in those countries. 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aCaribbean; Latin America  aDistribution  a Education  a Female  a Gender  a Women  aJournal Article  g48g3h915-30tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253547&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102379naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450087002311000018003181100009003365200936003456500060012816500076013416500066014176500109014836530009015926530011016016530015016126530015016276530013016426530015016556530014016706530015016846550020016997730030017198560006017498560198017559030016019531253548  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909908  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0050-3  aI23  aJ13  aJ16  aO1511aA Longitudinal Analysis of the Relationship between Fertility Timing and Schooling10aStange, Kevin  aU MI  aThis article quantifies the contribution of pre-treatment dynamic selection to the relationship between fertility timing and postsecondary attainment, after controlling for a rich set of predetermined characteristics. Eventual mothers and nonmothers are matched using their predicted birth hazard rate, which shares the desirable properties of a propensity score but in a multivalued treatment setting. I find that eventual mothers and matched nonmothers enter college at the same rate, but their educational paths diverge well before the former become pregnant. This pre-pregnancy divergence creates substantial differences in ultimate educational attainment that cannot possibly be due to the childbirth itself. Controls for predetermined characteristics and fixed effects do not address this form of dynamic selection bias. A dynamic model of the simultaneous childbirth-education sequencing decision is necessary to address it. 4aHigher Education; Research Institutions         b(I23) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBias  a Birth  a Education  a Fertility  a Mothers  a Pregnancy  a Pregnant  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g48g3h931-56tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253548&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102818naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450083002231000019003067000021003257000020003461100009003667100009003757100044003845201329004286500084017576500076018416500065019176530010019826530011019926530019020036530014020226530014020366530012020506530015020626530013020776530012020906550020021027730030021228560006021528560198021589030016023561253549  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909915  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0041-4  aJ12  aJ13  aJ3113aThe Evolution of Family Complexity from the Perspective of Nonmarital Children10aCancian, Maria10aMeyer, Daniel R.10aCook, Steven T.  aU WI  aU WI  aInstitute for Research on Poverty, U WI  aWe document the incidence and evolution of family complexity from the perspective of children. Following a cohort of firstborn children whose mothers were not married at the time of their birth, we consider family structure changes over the first 10 years of the child's life--considering both full and half-siblings who are coresidential or who live in another household. We rely on detailed longitudinal administrative data from Wisconsin that include information on the timing of subsequent births to the mother and father, and detailed information on earnings, child support, and welfare. We find that 60% of firstborn children of unmarried mothers have at least one half-sibling by age 10. Our results highlight the importance of having fertility information for both fathers and mothers: estimates of the proportion of children with half-siblings would be qualitatively lower if we had fertility information on only one parent. Complex family structures are more likely for children of parents who are younger or who have low earnings and for those in larger urban areas. Children who have half-siblings on their mother's side are also more likely to have half-siblings on their father's side, and vice versa, contributing to very complex family structures--and potential child support arrangements--for some children. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31)  aBirth  a Child  a Child Support  a Children  a Earnings  a Family  a Fertility  a Mothers  a Parent  aJournal Article  g48g3h957-82tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253549&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102374naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450060002151000020002757000024002951100051003197100009003705201157003796500069015366500084016056510009016896530012016986530014017106530016017246530012017406550020017527730032017728560006018048560198018109030016020081253550  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909913  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0043-2  aD31  aJ1210aCohabitation History, Marriage, and Wealth Accumulation10aVespa, Jonathan10aPainter, Matthew A.  aCenter for Human Resource Research, OH State U  aU WY  aThis study extends research on the relationship between wealth accumulation and union experiences, such as marriage and cohabitation. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, we explore the wealth trajectories of married individuals in light of their premarital cohabitation histories. Over time, marriage positively correlates with wealth accumulation. Most married persons with a premarital cohabitation history have wealth trajectories that are indistinguishable from those without cohabitation experience, with one exception: individuals who marry their one and only cohabiting partner experience a wealth premium that is twice as large as that for married individuals who never cohabited prior to marrying. Results remain robust over time despite cohabiters' selection out of marriage, yet vary by race/ethnicity. We conclude that relationship history may shape long-term wealth accumulation, and contrary to existing literature, individuals who marry their only cohabiting partners experience a beneficial marital outcome. It is therefore important to understand the diversity of cohabitation experiences among the married. 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aMarital  a Marriage  a Premarital  a Wealth  aJournal Article  g48g3h983-1004tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253550&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102877naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450104002231000017003277000019003447000015003637000018003781100014003967100011004107100016004217100027004375201384004646500084018486500076019326500066020086510011020746530010020856530011020956530015021066530014021216530013021356530012021486550020021607730031021808560006022118560198022179030016024151253551  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909912  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0046-z  aJ12  aJ13  aJ1610aDivorced Fathers' Proximity and Children's Long-Run Outcomes: Evidence from Norwegian Registry Data10aKalil, Ariel10aMogstad, Magne10aRege, Mari10aVotruba, Mark  aU Chicago  aU Oslo  aU Stavanger  aCase Western Reserve U  aThis study examines the link between divorced nonresident fathers' proximity and children's long-run outcomes, using high-quality data from Norwegian population registers. We follow (from birth to young adulthood) each of 15,992 children born into married households in Norway in the years 1975-1979 whose parents divorced during his or her childhood. We observe the proximity of the child to his or her father in each year following the divorce and link proximity to educational and economic outcomes for the child in young adulthood, controlling for a wide range of observable characteristics of the parents and the child. Our results show that closer proximity to the father following a divorce has, on average, a modest negative association with offspring's outcomes in young adulthood. The negative associations are stronger among children of highly educated fathers. Complementary Norwegian survey data show that highly educated fathers report more post-divorce conflict with their ex-wives as well as more contact with their children (measured in terms of the number of nights that the child spends at the father's house). Consequently, the father's relocation to a more distant location following the divorce may shelter the child from disruptions in the structure of the child's life as they split time between households and/or from post-divorce interparental conflict. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aNorway  aBirth  a Child  a Childhood  a Children  a Divorce  a Parent  aJournal Article  g48g3h1005-27tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253551&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201103279naa  2200541   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002230430008002310430008002392450062002471000023003097000021003327000020003531100015003737100015003887100023004035201320004266500076017466500066018226500065018886500067019536500119020206500172021396510015023116530010023266530011023366530014023476530019023616530015023806530021023956530013024166530015024296530011024446530011024556550020024667730031024868560006025178560198025239030016027211253552  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909914  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0039-y  aJ13  aJ16  aJ61  aO12  aO18  aR2310aMen's Migration and Women's Fertility in Rural Mozambique10aAgadjanian, Victor10aYabiku, Scott T.10aCau, Boaventura  aAZ State U  aAZ State U  aEduardo Mondlane U  aLabor migration profoundly affects households throughout rural Africa. This study looks at how men's labor migration influences marital fertility in a context where such migration has been massive while its economic returns are increasingly uncertain. Using data from a survey of married women in southern Mozambique, we start with an event-history analysis of birth rates among women married to migrants and those married to nonmigrants. The model detects a lower birth rate among migrants' wives, which tends to be partially compensated for by an increased birth rate upon cessation of migration. An analysis of women's lifetime fertility shows that it decreases as the time spent in migration by their husbands accrues. When we compare reproductive intentions stated by respondents with migrant and nonmigrant husbands, we find that migrants' wives are more likely to want another child regardless of the number of living children, but the difference is significant only for women who see migration as economically benefiting their households. Yet, such women are also significantly more likely to use modern contraception than other women. We interpret these results in light of the debate on enhancing versus disrupting effects of labor migration on families and households in contemporary developing settings. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aMicroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development         b(O12) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aMozambique  aBirth  a Child  a Children  a Contraception  a Fertility  a Labor Migration  a Migrant  a Migration  a Rural  a Women  aJournal Article  g48g3h1029-48tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253552&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102588naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450109002311000024003407000020003647000016003841100039004007100039004397100039004785201039005176500050015566500044016066500077016506500067017276510017017946530011018116530018018226530013018406530015018536530015018686550020018837730031019038560006019348560198019409030016021381253553  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909904  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0049-9  aE32  aF22  aJ11  aO1210aDeclining Return Migration from the United States to Mexico in the Late-2000s Recession: A Research Note10aRendall, Michael S.10aBrownell, Peter10aKups, Sarah  aRAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aRAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aRAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aResearchers in the United States and Mexico have variously asserted that return migration from the United States to Mexico increased substantially, remained unchanged, or declined slightly in response to the 2008-2009 U.S. recession and fall 2008 global financial crisis.

Declines in annual return-migration flows of up to a third between 2007 and 2009 were seen among the predominantly labor-migrant groups of male migrants and all 18- to 40-year-old migrants with less than a college education; and a decline in total return migration was seen in the fourth quarter of 2008 (immediately after the triggering of the global financial crisis) compared with the fourth quarter of 2007. 4aBusiness Fluctuations; Cycles         b(E32) 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMicroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development         b(O12)  aMexico; U.S.  aCrisis  a Demographics  a Migrant  a Migration  a Recession  aJournal Article  g48g3h1049-58tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253553&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102885naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450102002311000023003331100036003565201326003926500077017186500076017956500113018716500066019846510009020506530009020596530011020686530015020796530015020946530017021096530015021266530016021416530012021576530011021696550020021807730031022008560006022318560198022379030016024351253554  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909911  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0045-0  aJ11  aJ13  aJ15  aJ1610aHow High Is Hispanic/Mexican Fertility in the United States? Immigration and Tempo Considerations10aParrado, Emilio A.  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aI demonstrate that the apparently much higher fertility of Hispanic/Mexican women in the United States is almost exclusively the product of period estimates obtained for immigrant women and that period measures of immigrant fertility suffer from three serious sources of bias that together significantly overstate fertility levels: difficulties in estimating the size of immigrant groups; the tendency for migration to occur at a particular stage in life; and, most importantly, the tendency for women to have a birth soon after migration. When these sources of bias are taken into consideration, the fertility of native Hispanic/Mexican women is very close to replacement level. In addition, the completed fertility of immigrant women in the United States is dramatically lower than the level obtained from period calculations. Findings are consistent with classical theories of immigrant assimilation but are a striking departure from the patterns found in previous studies and published statistics. The main implication is that without a significant change in immigration levels, current projections based on the premise of high Hispanic fertility are likely to considerably exaggerate Hispanic population growth, its impact on the ethno-racial profile of the country, and its potential to counteract population aging. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aBias  a Birth  a Fertility  a Immigrant  a Immigration  a Migration  a Population  a Racial  a Women  aJournal Article  g48g3h1059-80tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253554&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102719naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450092002311000020003237000023003437000023003661100036003897100014004257100037004395201053004766500038015296500123015676500155016906500098018456510029019436530013019726530012019856530012019976530015020096550020020247730033020448560006020778560198020839030016022811253555  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909919  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0036-1  aI12  aP23  aP36  aZ1310aUnderstanding the 'Russian Mortality Paradox' in Central Asia: Evidence from Kyrgyzstan10aGuillot, Michel10aGavrilova, Natalia10aPudrovska, Tetyana  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aU Chicago  aPopulation Research Center, U TX  aIn the former Soviet republics of central Asia, ethnic Russians have exhibited higher adult mortality than native ethnic groups (e.g., Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek) in spite of the higher socioeconomic status of ethnic Russians. The mortality disadvantage of ethnic Russians at adult ages appears to have even increased since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The most common explanation for this "Russian mortality paradox," is that deaths are better reported among ethnic Russians. In this study, we use detailed mortality data from Kyrgyzstan between 1959 and 1999 to evaluate various explanations for the Russian mortality paradox: data artifacts, migration effects, and cultural effects. We find that the most plausible explanation is the cultural hypothesis because the personal behaviors that appear to generate a large part of the observed mortality differences (alcohol consumption, in particular) seem to be closely tied to cultural practices. We examine the implications of this finding for understanding the health crisis in post-Soviet states. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population         b(P23) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aCentral Asia; Kyrgyzstan  aCultural  a Deaths  a Health  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g48g3h1081-1104tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253555&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102192naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001992450059002071000024002661100039002905201241003296500038015706510009016086530011016176530015016286550020016437730031016638560006016948560198017009030016018981253556  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909920  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0035-2  aI1210aModerate Alcohol Consumption and the Risk of Mortality10aFuller, Theodore D.  aVA Polytechnic Institute & State U  aThere has been a growing consensus that moderate consumption of alcohol is associated with a lower risk of mortality and that this association is probably causal. However, a recent review article has raised a serious challenge to this consensus. In short, it determined that most prior research in this area committed serious misclassification errors; furthermore, among those studies that were free of these misclassification errors, no support for a protective role of alcohol consumption was found. This article reexamines the issue using prospective data for more than 124,000 persons interviewed in the U.S. National Health Interview Surveys of 1997 through 2000 with mortality follow-up through 2002 using the Linked Mortality File. The study involves about 488,000 person-years. Controlling for a variety of covariates, this study finds that compared with nondrinkers, those who consume a moderate amount of alcohol have lower all-cause and CHD mortality. The fact that the current study has taken care to avoid the pitfalls of some earlier studies and still finds that those who consume a moderate amount of alcohol have lower all-cause mortality and CHD mortality lends credence to the argument that the relationship is causal. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aHealth  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g48g3h1105-25tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253556&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102327naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450094002151000022003097000021003317000022003521100040003747100040004147100009004545201042004636500053015056500077015586510009016356530020016446530018016646530012016826550020016947730031017148560006017458560198017519030016019491253557  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909910  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0044-1  aC83  aJ1110aResponsive Survey Design, Demographic Data Collection, and Models of Demographic Behavior10aAxinn, William G.10aLink, Cynthia F.10aGroves, Robert M.  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aU MI  aTo address declining response rates and rising data-collection costs, survey methodologists have devised new techniques for using process data ("paradata") to address nonresponse by altering the survey design dynamically during data collection. We investigate the substantive consequences of responsive survey design--tools that use paradata to improve the representative qualities of surveys and control costs. By improving representation of reluctant respondents, responsive design can change our understanding of the topic being studied. Using the National Survey of Family Growth Cycle 6, we illustrate how responsive survey design can shape both demographic estimates and models of demographic behaviors based on survey data. By juxtaposing measures from regular and responsive data collection phases, we document how special efforts to interview reluctant respondents may affect demographic estimates. Results demonstrate the potential of responsive survey design to change the quality of demographic research based on survey data. 4aSurvey Methods; Sampling Methods         b(C83) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aData Collection  a Demographics  a Survey  aJournal Article  g48g3h1127-49tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253557&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102922naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002150430008002232450104002311000016003357000019003517000019003701100012003897100013004017100054004145201424004686500076018926500066019686500067020346500098021016510010021996530009022096530012022186530011022306550020022417730031022618560006022928560198022989030016024961253558  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909906  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0051-2  aJ13  aJ16  aO12  aZ1313aThe Relationship History Calendar: Improving the Scope and Quality of Data on Youth Sexual Behavior10aLuke, Nancy10aClark, Shelley10aZulu, Eliya M.  aBrown U  aMcGill U  aAfrican Institute for Development Policy, Nairobi  aMost survey data on sexual activities are obtained via face-to-face interviews, which are prone to misreporting of socially unacceptable behaviors. Demographers have developed various private response methods to minimize social desirability bias and improve the quality of reporting; however, these methods often limit the complexity of information collected. We designed a life history calendar--the relationship history calendar (RHC)--to increase the scope of data collected on sexual relationships and behavior while enhancing their quality. The RHC records detailed, 10-year retrospective information on sexual relationship histories. The structure and interview procedure draw on qualitative techniques, which could reduce social desirability bias. We compare the quality of data collected with the RHC with a standard face-to-face survey instrument through a field experiment conducted among 1,275 youth in Kisumu, Kenya. The results suggest that the RHC reduces social desirability bias and improves reporting on multiple measures, including higher rates of abstinence among males and multiple recent sexual partnerships among females. The RHC fosters higher levels of rapport and respondent enjoyment, which appear to be the mechanisms through which social desirability bias is minimized. The RHC is an excellent alternative to private response methods and could potentially be adapted for large-scale surveys. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aMicroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development         b(O12) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aKenya  aBias  a Female  a Youth  aJournal Article  g48g3h1151-76tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253558&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102422naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002072450068002151000017002837000018003007000023003187000028003411100012003697100012003817100035003937100015004285201163004436500064016066500098016706510009017686530010017776550020017877730033018078560006018408560198018469030016020441253559  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909916  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0042-3  aK42  aZ1310aLife Shocks and Crime: A Test of the 'Turning Point' Hypothesis10aCorman, Hope10aNoonan, Kelly10aReichman, Nancy E.20aSchwartz-Soicher, Ofira  aRider U  aRider U  aU Medicine and Dentistry of NJ  aColumbia U  aOther researchers have posited that important events in men's lives--such as employment, marriage, and parenthood--strengthen their social ties and lead them to refrain from crime. A challenge in empirically testing this hypothesis has been the issue of self-selection into life transitions. This study contributes to this literature by estimating the effects of an exogenous life shock on crime. We use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, augmented with information from hospital medical records, to estimate the effects of the birth of a child with a severe health problem on the likelihood that the infant's father engages in illegal activities. We conduct a number of auxiliary analyses to examine exogeneity assumptions. We find that having an infant born with a severe health condition increases the likelihood that the father is convicted of a crime in the three-year period following the birth of the child, and at least part of the effect appears to operate through work and changes in parental relationships. These results provide evidence that life events can cause crime and, as such, support the "turning point" hypothesis. 4aIllegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law         b(K42) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aU.S.  aCrime  aJournal Article  g48g3h1177-1202tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253559&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201103137naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910370048001510430008001990430008002070430008002152450074002231000019002977000018003161100051003347100009003855201769003946500066021636500102022296500172023316510009025036530016025126550020025287730031025488560006025798560198025859030016027831253560  a201109       201108                        eng     aEP62909909  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13524-011-0047-y  aJ16  aR21  aR2313aThe Determinants of Neighborhood Satisfaction: Racial Proxy Revisited10aSwaroop, Sapna10aKrysan, Maria  aInvitation Health and Wellness, Inc, Eagan, MN  aU IL  aUnderstanding the factors that drive individuals' residential preferences is a critical issue in the study of racial segregation. An important debate within this field is whether individuals--especially whites--prefer to live in predominantly white neighborhoods because they wish to avoid the social problems that may be more likely to occur in predominantly black neighborhoods (i.e., the racial proxy hypothesis) or because of racial factors that go beyond these social class-related characteristics. Through a multilevel analysis of data from the 2004-2005 Chicago Area Study and several administrative sources, we assess the extent to which the racial proxy hypothesis describes neighborhood satisfaction among whites, African Americans, and Latinos living across a broad range of neighborhood contexts. The racial proxy perspective applies weakly to whites' satisfaction: whites report less satisfaction in neighborhoods with more minority residents, and only some of their dissatisfaction can be attributed to local social characteristics. The racial proxy hypothesis applies more strongly to blacks' and Latinos' satisfaction. In some cases, especially for Latinos, higher levels of satisfaction in integrated neighborhoods can largely be attributed to the fact that these places have better socioeconomic conditions and fewer social problems than predominantly minority communities. At the same time, effects of racial/ethnic composition persist in unique and somewhat divergent ways for blacks and Latinos, supporting the assertion that racial composition matters, above and beyond its relation to social class. Taken together, these findings suggest that individuals balance both socioeconomic and race-related concerns in their residential preferences. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand         b(R21) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aResidential  aJournal Article  g48g3h1203-29tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1253560&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201102180naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450058001751000029002337000023002621100016002857100016003015201012003176500044013296500046013736500077014196510010014966530013015066530029015196530015015486550020015637730030015838560006016138560198016199030013018171275953  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800457  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aF22  aH56  aJ1110aIndividual Decisions to Migrate during Civil Conflict20aBohra-Mishra, Pratikshya10aMassey, Douglas S.  aPrinceton U  aPrinceton U  aThe existing literature on forced migration limits our understanding of how violence affects migration to competing destinations. This article adds to the literature on forced migration by studying how armed violence during a period of civil conflict in south-central Nepal influenced the likelihood of local, internal, and international migration. We find that violence has a nonlinear effect on migration, such that low to moderate levels of violence reduce the odds of movement, but when violence reaches high levels, the odds of movement increase. We also find that the effect of violence on mobility increases as the distance of the move increases. When we consider the influence of violence on microlevel decision-making, we find that the effects of individual and household-level determinants were mostly consistent with hypotheses derived from contemporary theories of voluntary migration and that no predictor of migration influenced the decision to migrate differently in the presence of violence. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aNational Security and War         b(H56) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aNepal  aConflict  a International Migration  a Migration  aJournal Article  g48g2h401-24tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275953&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102340naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450159001671000021003261100009003475201268003566500038016246500113016626510009017756530011017846550020017957730030018158560006018458560198018519030013020491275954  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800456  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1510aSimulating the Effects of Acculturation and Return Migration on the Maternal and Infant Health of Mexican Immigrants in the United States: A Research Note10aCeballos, Miguel  aU NE  aA significant body of research on minority health shows that although Latino immigrants experience unexpectedly favorable outcomes in maternal and infant health, this advantage deteriorates with increased time of residence in the United States. This study evaluates the underlying assumptions of two competing hypotheses that explain this paradox. The first hypothesis attributes this deterioration to possible negative effects of acculturation and behavioral adjustments made by immigrants while living in the United States, and the second hypothesis attributes this deterioration to the mechanism of selective return migration. Hypothetical probabilistic models are simulated for assessing the relationship between duration and birth outcomes based on the assumptions of these two hypotheses. The results are compared with the empirical research on the maternal and infant health of first-generation, Mexican-origin immigrant women in the United States. The analysis provides evidence that a curvilinear pattern of duration and birth outcomes can be explained by the joint effects of both acculturation and selective return migration in which the former affects health status over the longer durations, and the latter affects health status at shorter durations. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aHealth  aJournal Article  g48g2h425-36tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275954&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102908naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450125001831000024003081100015003325201465003476500056018126500084018686500076019526500113020286510009021416530010021506530014021606530014021746530012021886530012022006530012022126530019022246550020022437730030022638560006022938560198022999030013024971275955  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800445  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI32  aJ12  aJ13  aJ1510aFamilial Influences on Poverty among Young Children in Black Immigrant, U.S.-Born Black, and Nonblack Immigrant Families10aThomas, Kevin J. A.  aPA State U  aThis study examines how familial contexts affect poverty disparities between the children of immigrant and U.S.-born blacks, and among black and nonblack children of immigrants. Despite lower gross child poverty rates in immigrant than in U.S.-born black families, accounting for differences in family structure reveals that child poverty risks among blacks are highest in single-parent black immigrant families. In addition, within two-parent immigrant families, child poverty declines associated with increasing assimilation are greater than the respective declines in single-parent families. The heads of black immigrant households have more schooling than those of native-black households. However, increased schooling has a weaker negative association with child poverty among the former than among the latter. In terms of racial disparities among the children of immigrants, poverty rates are higher among black than nonblack children. This black disadvantage is, however, driven by the outcomes of first-generation children of African and Hispanic-black immigrants. The results also show that although children in refugee families face elevated poverty risks, these risks are higher among black than among nonblack children of refugees. In addition, the poverty-reducing impact associated with having an English-proficient household head is about three times lower among black children of immigrants than among non-Hispanic white children of immigrants. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Families  a Family  a Parent  a Racial  a Single Parent  aJournal Article  g48g2h437-60tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275955&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102128naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450095001591000022002547000021002761100059002977100019003565201027003756500038014026510023014406530011014636530012014746530015014866530021015016530013015226550020015357730030015558560006015858560198015919030013017891275956  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800453  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1210aEstimating the Effect of Smoking on Slowdowns in Mortality Declines in Developed Countries10aRostron, Brian L.10aWilmoth, John R.  aNational Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, MD  aU CA, Berkeley  aDeclines in mortality rates for females at older ages in some developed countries, including the United States, have slowed in recent decades even as decreases have steadily continued in some other countries. This study presents a modified version of the indirect Peto-Lopez method, which uses lung cancer mortality rates as a proxy for smoking exposure, to analyze this trend. The modified method estimates smoking-attributable mortality for more-specific age groups than does the Peto-Lopez method. An adjustment factor is also introduced to account for low mortality in the indirect method's study population. These modifications are shown to be useful specifically in the estimation of deaths attributable to smoking for females at older ages, and in the estimation of smoking-attributable mortality more generally. In a comparison made between the United States and France with the modified method, smoking is found to be responsible for approximately one-half the difference in life expectancy for females at age 65. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aSelected Countries  aCancer  a Deaths  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g48g2h461-79tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275956&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102531naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450072001671000024002397000023002637000026002867000020003121100039003327100039003717100036004107100038004465201184004846500038016686500084017066510009017906530011017996530013018106530014018236530015018376530013018526550020018657730031018858560006019168560198019229030013021201275957  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800455  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1213aThe Protective Effect of Marriage for Survival: A Review and Update10aRendall, Michael S.10aWeden, Margaret M.10aFavreault, Melissa M.10aWaldron, Hilary  aRAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aRAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aUrban Institute, Washington, DC  aUS Social Security Administration  aThe theory that marriage has protective effects for survival has itself lived for more than 100 years since Durkheim's groundbreaking study of suicide (Durkheim 1951 [1897]). Investigations of differences in this protective effect by gender, by age, and in contrast to different unmarried statuses, however, have yielded inconsistent conclusions. These investigations typically either use data in which marital status and other covariates are observed in cross-sectional surveys up to 10 years before mortality exposure, or use data from panel surveys with much smaller sample sizes. Their conclusions are usually not based on formal statistical tests of contrasts between men and women or between never-married, divorced/separated, and widowed statuses. Using large-scale pooled panel survey data linked to death registrations and earnings histories for U.S. men and women aged 25 and older, and with appropriate contrast tests, we find a consistent survival advantage for married over unmarried men and women, and an additional survival "premium" for married men. We find little evidence of mortality differences between never-married, divorced/separated, and widowed statuses. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Marital  a Marriage  a Mortality  a Suicide  aJournal Article  g48g2h481-506tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275957&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102540naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450189001751000028003647000032003927000023004241100032004477100073004797100023005525200999005756500050015746500038016246500076016626510012017386530010017506530020017606530012017806530011017926530012018036530015018156530021018306550020018517730030018718560006019018560198019079030013021051275958  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800451  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aE32  aI12  aJ1310aBeing Born under Adverse Economic Conditions Leads to a Higher Cardiovascular Mortality Rate Later in Life: Evidence Based on Individuals Born at Different Stages of the Business Cycle10avan den Berg, Gerard J.20aDoblhammer-Reiter, Gabriele10aChristensen, Kaare  aU Mannheim and IFAU Uppsala  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock and U Rostock  aU Southern Denmark  aWe connect the recent medical and economic literatures on the long-run effects of early-life conditions by analyzing the effects of economic conditions on the individual cardiovascular (CV) mortality rate later in life, using individual data records from the Danish Twin Registry covering births since the 1870s and including the cause of death. To capture exogenous variation of conditions early in life, we use the state of the business cycle around birth. We find significant negative effects of economic conditions around birth on the individual CV mortality rate at higher ages. There is no effect on the cancer-specific mortality rate. From variation within and between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs born under different conditions, we conclude that the fate of an individual is more strongly determined by genetic and household-environmental factors if early-life conditions are poor. Individual-specific qualities come more to fruition if the starting position in life is better. 4aBusiness Fluctuations; Cycles         b(E32) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aDenmark  aBirth  a Business Cycle  a Cancer  a Cycle  a Deaths  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  aJournal Article  g48g2h507-30tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275958&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201103020naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450113001751000023002887000026003117000027003371100070003647100018004347100054004525201411005066500038019176500076019556500172020316510023022036530010022266530018022366530013022546530015022676530015022826530021022976530013023186550020023317730030023518560006023818560198023879030013025851275959  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800460  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aR2310aIs There an Urban Advantage in Child Survival in Sub-Saharan Africa?

However, less attention has been paid to comparing the situation of the same families before and after they migrate with the situation of urban-to-rural migrants. We use DHS data from 18 African countries to compare child mortality rates of six groups based on their mothers' migration status: rural nonmigrants; urban nonmigrants; rural-to-urban migrants before and after they migrate; and urban-to-rural migrants before and after they migrate. The results show that rural-to-urban migrants had, on average, lower child mortality before they migrated than rural nonmigrants, and that their mortality levels dropped further after they arrived in urban areas. We found no systematic evidence of higher child mortality for rural-to-urban migrants compared with urban nonmigrants. Urban-to-rural migrants had higher mortality in the urban areas, and their move to rural areas appeared advantageous because they experienced lower or similar child mortality after living in rural areas. After we control for known demographic and socioeconomic correlates of under-5 mortality, the urban advantage is greatly reduced and sometimes reversed. The results suggest that it may not be necessarily the place of residence that matters for child survival but, rather, access to services and economic opportunities. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aSub-Saharan Africa  aChild  a Demographics  a Migrant  a Migration  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g48g2h531-58tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275959&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102243naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450085001671000027002527000017002797000022002967000020003181100065003387100065004037100137004687100015006055200783006206500076014036500098014796510012015776530010015896530015015996550020016147730030016348560006016648560198016709030013018681275960  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800454  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aZ1310aTransition to Parenthood: The Role of Social Interaction and Endogenous Networks10aDiaz, Belinda Aparicio10aFent, Thomas10aPrskawetz, Alexia10aBernardi, Laura  aVienna Institute of Demography, Austrian Academy of Sciences  aVienna Institute of Demography, Austrian Academy of Sciences  aVienna Institute of Demography, Austrian Academy of Sciences and Institute of Mathematical Methods in Economics, Vienna U Technology  aU Lausanne  aEmpirical studies indicate that the transition to parenthood is influenced by an individual's peer group. To study the mechanisms creating interdependencies across individuals' transition to parenthood and its timing, we apply an agent-based simulation model. We build a one-sex model and provide agents with three different characteristics: age, intended education, and parity. Agents endogenously form their network based on social closeness. Network members may then influence the agents' transition to higher parity levels. Our numerical simulations indicate that accounting for social interactions can explain the shift of first-birth probabilities in Austria during the period 1984 to 2004. Moreover, we apply our model to forecast age-specific fertility rates up to 2016. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aAustria  aBirth  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g48g2h559-79tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275960&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201101896naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450149001591000027003081100009003355200900003446500084012446510009013286530012013376530014013496550020013637730030013838560006014138560198014199030013016171275961  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800452  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aMore Evidence for Trends in the Intergenerational Transmission of Divorce: A Completed Cohort Approach Using Data from the General Social Survey10aWolfinger, Nicholas H.  aU UT  aMany studies have demonstrated that the children of divorce are disproportionately likely to end their own marriages. In previous work, I showed that the transmission of divorce between generations weakened substantially for General Social Survey (GSS) respondents interviewed between 1973 and 1996 (Wolfinger 1999); Li and Wu (2006, 2008) contended that my finding is a methodological artifact of the GSS's lack of marriage duration data. This article presents a completed-cohort approach to studying divorce using the GSS. The results confirm a decline in the probability of divorce transmission that cannot be explained by the right-censoring bias alleged by Li and Wu. This finding contributes to an ongoing debate about trends in the negative consequences of parental divorce, as well as demonstrating a useful approach to right-censored phenomena when event history data are not available. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aDivorce  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g48g2h581-92tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275961&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102635naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450091001671000025002587000021002837000019003047000025003231100020003487100009003687100020003777100020003975201342004176500084017596500076018436510009019196530012019286530014019406530016019546530011019706550020019817730031020018560006020328560198020389030013022361275962  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800448  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aPathways of Early Fatherhood, Marriage, and Employment: A Latent Class Growth Analysis10aDariotis, Jacinda K.10aPleck, Joseph H.10aAstone, Nan M.10aSonenstein, Freya L.  aJohns Hopkins U  aU IL  aJohns Hopkins U  aJohns Hopkins U  aIn the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), young fathers include heterogeneous subgroups with varying early life pathways in terms of fatherhood timing, the timing of first marriage, and holding full-time employment. Using latent class growth analysis with 10 observations between ages 18 and 37, we derived five latent classes with median ages of first fatherhood below the cohort median (26.4), constituting distinct early fatherhood pathways representing 32.4% of NLSY men: (A) Young Married Fathers, (B) Teen Married Fathers, (C) Young Underemployed Married Fathers, (D) Young Underemployed Single Fathers, and (E) Young Later-Marrying Fathers. A sixth latent class of men who become fathers around the cohort median, following full-time employment and marriage (On-Time On-Sequence Fathers), is the comparison group. With sociodemographic background controlled, all early fatherhood pathways show disadvantage in at least some later-life circumstances (earnings, educational attainment, marital status, and incarceration). The extent of disadvantage is greater when early fatherhood occurs at relatively younger ages (before age 20), occurs outside marriage, or occurs outside full-time employment. The relative disadvantage associated with early fatherhood, unlike early motherhood, increases over the life course. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aMarital  a Marriage  a Motherhood  a Youth  aJournal Article  g48g2h593-623tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275962&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102558naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450110001591000026002697000025002957000020003207000021003407000020003617000029003811100009004107100009004197100009004287100009004377100013004467100009004595201387004686500042018556510009018976530011019066550020019177730030019378560006019678560198019739030013021711275963  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800446  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1410aIntergenerational Profiles of Socioeconomic (Dis)advantage and Obesity during the Transition to Adulthood20aScharoun-Lee, Melissa20aGordon-Larsen, Penny10aAdair, Linda S.10aPopkin, Barry M.10aKaufman, Jay S.10aSuchindran, Chirayath M.  aU NC  aU NC  aU NC  aU NC  aMcGill U  aU NC  aInvestigations of socioeconomic status (SES) and health during the transition to adulthood in the United States are complicated by the later and more varied transitions in residence, employment, schooling, and social roles compared with previous generations. Parental SES is an important influence during adolescence but cannot sufficiently capture the SES of the independent young adult. Typical, single SES indicators based on income or education likely misclassify the SES of young adults who have not yet completed their education or other training, or who have entered the labor force early with ultimately lower status attainment. We use a latent class analysis (LCA) framework to characterize five intergenerational SES groups, combining multidimensional SES information from two time points--that is, adolescent (parental) and young adult (self) SES data. Associations of these groups with obesity, a high-risk health outcome in young adults, revealed nuanced relationships not seen using traditional intergenerational SES measures. In males, for example, a middle-class upbringing in adolescence and continued material advantage into adulthood was associated with nearly as high obesity as a working poor upbringing and early, detrimental transitions. This intergenerational typology of early SES exposure facilitates understanding of SES and health during young adulthood. 4aHealth and Inequality         b(I14)  aU.S.  aHealth  aJournal Article  g48g2h625-51tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275963&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102132naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450102001671000020002697000022002891100009003117100011003205201104003316500042014356500052014776510023015296530011015526550020015637730030015838560006016138560198016199030013018171275964  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800447  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI14  aI1510aCross-National Sources of Health Inequality: Education and Tobacco Use in the World Health Survey10aPampel, Fred C.10aDenney, Justin T.  aU CO  aRice U  aThe spread of tobacco use from the West to other parts of the world, especially among disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, raises concerns not only about the indisputable harm to global health but also about worsening health inequality. Arguments relating to economic cost and diffusion posit that rising educational disparities in tobacco use--and associated disparities in health and premature mortality--are associated with higher national income and more advanced stages of cigarette diffusion, particularly among younger persons and males. To test these arguments, we use World Health Survey data for 99,661 men and 123,953 women from 50 low-income to upper-middle-income nations. Multilevel logistic regression models show that increases in national income and cigarette diffusion widen educational disparities in smoking among young persons and men but have weaker influences among older persons and women. The results suggest that the social and economic patterns of cigarette adoption across low- and middle-income nations foretell continuing, and perhaps widening, disparities in mortality. 4aHealth and Inequality         b(I14) 4aHealth and Economic Development         b(I15)  aSelected Countries  aHealth  aJournal Article  g48g2h653-74tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275964&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102257naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450111001671000015002787000022002931100016003157100016003315201140003476500052014876500038015396510023015776530009016006530012016096530017016216530014016386550020016527730030016728560006017028560198017089030013019061275965  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800458  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI11  aI1213aThe Impact of the AIDS Pandemic on Health Services in Africa: Evidence from Demographic and Health Surveys10aCase, Anne10aPaxson, Christina  aPrinceton U  aPrinceton U  aWe document the impact of the AIDS crisis on non-AIDS-related health services in 14 sub-Saharan African countries. Using multiple waves of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for each country, we examine antenatal care, birth deliveries, and rates of immunization for children born between 1988 and 2005. We find deterioration in nearly all these dimensions of health care over this period. The most recent DHS survey for each country collected data on HIV prevalence, which allows us to examine the association between HIV burden and health care. We find that erosion of health services is the largest in regions that have developed the highest rates of HIV. Regions of countries that have light AIDS burdens have witnessed small or no declines in health care, using the measures noted above, while those regions shouldering the heaviest burdens have seen the largest erosion in non-HIV-related health services for pregnant women and children. Using semiparametric techniques, we can date the beginning of the divergence in the use of antenatal care and in children's immunizations between high- and low-HIV regions to the mid-1990s. 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aSub-Saharan Africa  aAIDS  a Health  a Health Care  a Pandemic  aJournal Article  g48g2h675-97tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275965&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102710naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450127001831000025003107000018003351100013003537100013003665201420003796500036017996500038018356500042018736500108019156510009020236530011020326530012020436530013020556550020020687730031020888560006021198560198021259030013023231275966  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800444  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI10  aI12  aI14  aJ1410aHealth Measurement in Population Surveys: Combining Information from Self-Reported and Observer-Measured Health Indicators10aPloubidis, George B.10aGrundy, Emily  aU London  aU London  aOur primary aim is to develop and validate a population health metric for survey-based health assessment that combines information from both self-reported and observer-measured health indicators. A secondary objective is to use this index to examine gender and socioeconomic differentials in the health status of older people. We use data from the second wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) conducted in 2004 (N = 8,870). Information from three observer-measured and three self-reported health indicators was combined, using a latent variable modeling approach. A model that decomposed the manifest health indicators to valid health, systematic error, and random error was found to fit the data best. The latent health dimension represented somatic health, and was tested against three external criteria: height, waist-hip ratio, and smoking status. We present the Latent Index of Somatic Health (LISH), as well as a procedure for deriving the LISH in surveys employing both self- and observer-measured health indicators. Observer-measured and self-reported indicators were found to be equally biased in indexing population somatic health, with the exception of self-reports of functional limitations, which was the most reliable somatic health indicator. As expected, results showed that women had worse health than men and that socioeconomic advantage is associated with better somatic health. 4aHealth: General         b(I10) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth and Inequality         b(I14) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.K.  aAgeing  a Health  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g48g2h699-724tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275966&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102370naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450059001671000020002267000022002467000021002681100009002897100015002987100009003135201161003226500064014836500076015476510009016236530013016326530018016456530015016636530012016786530012016906530015017026550020017177730030017378560006017678560198017739030013019711275967  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800449  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aH51  aJ1310aMedicaid Expansions and Fertility in the United States10aDeLeire, Thomas10aLopoo, Leonard M.10aSimon, Kosali I.  aU WI  aSyracuse U  aIN U  aBeginning in the mid-1980s and extending through the early to mid-1990s, a substantial number of women and children in the United States gained eligibility for Medicaid through a series of income-based expansions. Using natality data from the National Center for Health Statistics, we estimate fertility responses to these eligibility expansions. We follow Currie and Gruber (2001) and measure changes in state Medicaid-eligibility policy by simulating the fraction of a standard population that would qualify for benefits in different states and different time periods. From 1985 to 1996, the fraction of women aged 15-44 who were eligible for Medicaid coverage for a pregnancy increased more than 20 percentage points. When we use a state and year fixed-effects model with a limited set of covariates, our estimates indicate that fertility increases in response to Medicaid expansions. However, after we include fixed effects for demographic characteristics, the estimated relationship diminishes substantially in size and is no longer statistically significant. We conclude that there is no robust relationship between Medicaid expansions and fertility. 4aNational Government Expenditures and Health         b(H51) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Demographics  a Fertility  a Health  a Policy  a Pregnancy  aJournal Article  g48g2h725-47tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275967&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102681naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450116001751000021002917000024003121100026003367100011003625201314003736500076016876500109017636500125018726510013019976530018020106530021020286530015020496550020020647730030020848560006021148560198021209030013023181275968  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800450  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO15  aO1610aMicrocredit, Family Planning Programs, and Contraceptive Behavior: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Ethiopia10aDesai, Jaikishan10aTarozzi, Alessandro  aVictoria U Wellington  aDuke U  aThe impact of community-based family planning programs and access to credit on contraceptive use, fertility, and family size preferences has not been established conclusively in the literature. We provide additional evidence on the possible effect of such programs by describing the results of a randomized field experiment whose main purpose was to increase the use of contraceptive methods in rural areas of Ethiopia. In the experiment, administrative areas were randomly allocated to one of three intervention groups or to a fourth control group. In the first intervention group, both credit and family planning services were provided and the credit officers also provided information on family planning. Only credit or family planning services, but not both, were provided in the other two intervention groups, while areas in the control group received neither type of service. Using pre- and post-intervention surveys, we find that neither type of program, combined or in isolation, led to an increase in contraceptive use that is significantly greater than that observed in the control group. We conjecture that the lack of impact has much to do with the mismatch between women's preferred contraceptive method (injectibles) and the contraceptives provided by community-based agents (pills and condoms). 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Financial Markets; Saving and Capital Investment; Corporate Finance and Governance         b(O16)  aEthiopia  aContraceptive  a Family Planning  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g48g2h749-82tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275968&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102600naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450057001751000023002321100023002555201336002786500076016146500066016906500155017566510010019116530010019216530011019316530012019426530015019546530013019696550020019827730031020028560006020338560198020399030013022371275969  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800461  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ16  aP3610aEstimating a Dynamic Model of Sex Selection in China10aEbenstein, Avraham  aHebrew U Jerusalem  aHigh ratios of males to females in China, which have historically concerned researchers (Sen 1990), have increased in the wake of China's one-child policy, which began in 1979. Chinese policymakers are currently attempting to correct the imbalance in the sex ratio through initiatives that provide financial compensation to parents with daughters. Other scholars have advocated a relaxation of the one-child policy to allow more parents to have a son without engaging in sex selection. In this article, I present a model of fertility choice when parents have access to a sex-selection technology and face a mandated fertility limit. By exploiting variation in fines levied in China for unsanctioned births, I estimate the relative price of a son and daughter for mothers observed in China's census data (1982-2000). I find that a couple's first son is worth 1.42 years of income more than a first daughter, and the premium is highest among less-educated mothers and families engaged in agriculture. Simulations indicate that a subsidy of 1 year of income to families without a son would reduce the number of "missing girls" by 67% but impose an annual cost of 1.8% of Chinese gross domestic product (GDP). Alternatively, a three-child policy would reduce the number of "missing girls" by 56% but increase the fertility rate by 35%. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36)  aChina  aBirth  a Child  a Female  a Fertility  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g48g2h783-811tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275969&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201101807naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001830430008001912450086001991000022002857000025003071100014003327100014003466500077003606500064004376500166005016500163006676500124008306500121009546510009010756530010010846530017010946530019011116550020011307730030011508560006011808560198011869030013013841275970  a201201       201105                        eng     aEP60800459  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aK42  aN31  aN32  aN41  aN4210aImmigration, Crime, and Incarceration in Early Twentieth-Century America: Erratum10aMoehling, Carolyn10aPiehl, Anne Morrison  aRutgers U  aRutgers U 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aIllegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law         b(K42) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32) 4aEconomic History: Government, War, Law, International Relations, and Regulation: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N41) 4aEconomic History: Government, War, Law, International Relations, and Regulation: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N42)  aU.S.  aCrime  a Immigration  a Incarceration  aJournal Article  g48g2h813-14tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275970&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201102229naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450043001751000020002181100009002385201146002476500069013936500094014626500098015566530015016546550020016697730028016898560006017178560198017239030018019211275938  a201201       201102                        eng     aEP59341988  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD31  aD63  aZ1311aA Multigenerational View of Inequality10aMare, Robert D.  aUCLA  aThe study of intergenerational mobility and most population research are governed by a two-generation (parent-to-offspring) view of intergenerational influence, to the neglect of the effects of grandparents and other ancestors and nonresident contemporary kin. While appropriate for some populations in some periods, this perspective may omit important sources of intergenerational continuity of family-based social inequality. Social institutions, which transcend individual lives, help support multigenerational influence, particularly at the extreme top and bottom of the social hierarchy, but to some extent in the middle as well. Multigenerational influence also works through demographic processes because families influence subsequent generations through differential fertility and survival, migration, and marriage patterns, as well as through direct transmission of socioeconomic rewards, statuses, and positions. Future research should attend more closely to multigenerational effects; to the tandem nature of demographic and socioeconomic reproduction; and to data, measures, and models that transcend coresident nuclear families. 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aEquity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement         b(D63) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aInequality  aJournal Article  g48g1h1-23tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275938&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201102619naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450072001751000019002477000021002667000019002871100015003067100015003217100014003365201243003506500084015936500076016776500064017536510009018176530010018266530019018366530014018556530014018696530012018836530019018956530012019146550020019267730029019468560006019758560198019819030018021791275939  a201201       201102                        eng     aEP59341991  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ13  aK4210aPaternal Incarceration and Support for Children in Fragile Families10aGeller, Amanda10aGarfinkel, Irwin10aWestern, Bruce  aColumbia U  aColumbia U  aHarvard U  aHigh U.S. incarceration rates have motivated recent research on the negative effects of imprisonment on later employment, earnings, and family relationships. Because most men in jail and prison are fathers, a large number of children may be placed at considerable risk by policies of incarceration. This article examines one dimension of the economic risk faced by children of incarcerated fathers: the reduction in the financial support that they receive. We use a population-based sample of urban children to examine the effects of incarceration on this support. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal regressions indicate that formerly incarcerated men are less likely to contribute to their families, and those who do contribute provide significantly less. The negative effects of incarceration on fathers' financial support are due not only to the low earnings of formerly incarcerated men but also to their increased likelihood to live apart from their children. Men contribute far less through child support (formal or informal) than they do when they share their earnings within their household, suggesting that the destabilizing effects of incarceration on family relationships place children at significant economic disadvantage. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aIllegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law         b(K42)  aU.S.  aChild  a Child Support  a Children  a Families  a Family  a Incarceration  a Prison  aJournal Article  g48g1h25-47tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275939&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201102368naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450060001751000017002357000021002521100016002737100016002895201092003056500084013976500076014816500113015576510016016706530010016866530014016966530014017106530011017246550020017357730029017558560006017848560198017909030018019881275940  a201201       201102                        eng     aEP59341989  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ13  aJ1510aEthnic Differences in Leaving Home: Timing and Pathways10aZorlu, Aslan10aMulder, Clara H.  aU Amsterdam  aU Amsterdam  aThe dynamics of leaving home for youth from migrant families in the Netherlands are examined using individual administrative data on the 1977 and 1983 birth cohorts for the period 1999-2004. A competing-risks approach is applied to distinguish leaving home for union formation, to live independently, and to share with others. Migrant youth, and particularly Turkish and Moroccan youth, leave home at a significantly younger age than Dutch youth, given the relevant background variables. This is remarkable, given the older ages at which young people in the origin countries leave the parental home. The result may be seen as evidence of how the potential effects of cultural norms are counter-affected by other factors, such as the facilities of the welfare state and the awkward position of migrant youth between two cultures. Considering the pathways out of home, the analysis largely confirms the expected pattern: Turkish and Moroccan youth leave home more often for union formation and particularly marriage, while this pathway is of minor importance for Dutch youth at early ages. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aNetherlands  aBirth  a Families  a Marriage  a Youth  aJournal Article  g48g1h49-72tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275940&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201102656naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450097001831000028002801100009003085201323003176500042016406500076016826500053017586500065018116510011018766530017018876530015019046530015019196530013019346530015019476530014019626530011019766550020019877730029020078560006020368560198020429030018022401275941  a201201       201102                        eng     aEP59341996  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ13  aJ22  aJ6113aThe Effect of Family Member Migration on Education and Work among Nonmigrant Youth in Mexico20aHalpern-Manners, Andrew  aU MN  aWhile academic and policy circles have given much attention to the assimilatory experiences of Mexican immigrants in the United States, less is known about those who stay behind--an especially unfortunate oversight given the increasing number of Mexican youth with migrant family members. Of the studies on this topic, most have sought to identify the effect that migration has on youths' migratory and educational aspirations, often using qualitative methods in individual sending communities. The present article supplements this research in two ways: (1) in addition to assessing educational outcomes, the scope of the analysis is expanded to include nonmigrants' interaction with another homeland institution of upward mobility: the labor market; and (2) using a large demographic data set, statistical techniques are employed to adjust for unobserved selectivity into the migrant family-member population, thus accounting for a potentially serious source of bias. The results suggest that youth in migrant-sending families are less likely to complete the educational transitions leading up to postsecondary school and have a lower probability of participating in the local economy. The results also indicate that unobserved factors play a "nonignorable" role in sorting youth into migrant and nonmigrant families. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aMexico  aDemographics  a Education  a Immigrant  a Migrant  a Migration  a Mobility  a Youth  aJournal Article  g48g1h73-99tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275941&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201102120naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450067001671000024002347000022002581100009002807100020002895201045003096500071013546500076014256510009015016530010015106530014015206550020015347730030015548560006015848560198015909030018017881275942  a201201       201102                        eng     aEP59341994  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD13  aJ1310aChildren's Experiences after the Unintended Birth of a Sibling10aBarber, Jennifer S.10aEast, Patricia L.  aU MI  aU CA, San Diego  aThis study examines whether children with a younger sibling whose birth was unintended experience larger declines in the quality of their home environment and larger increases in behavioral problems than children whose younger sibling's birth was intended. We use data from the NLSY79 to estimate cross-lag regression models that assess changes in the home environment and children's behavioral problems after the birth of a sibling (intended or unintended). Results are consistent with our hypotheses, finding that, indeed, unintended births have negative spillover effects. Compared with children whose sibling's birth was intended, both boys and girls whose sibling's birth was unintended experienced larger declines in the quality of their home environment, and boys had larger increases in behavioral problems. We also find some unexpected evidence that mistimed births may have larger negative effects than unwanted births. This deserves further research, and we offer some possible explanations that could guide those investigations. 4aHousehold Production and Intrahousehold Allocation         b(D13) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Children  aJournal Article  g48g1h101-25tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275942&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201102322naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450080001671000024002477000023002711100011002947100011003055201211003166500042015276500113015696510009016826530011016916530010017026530012017126550020017247730030017448560006017748560198017809030018019781275943  a201201       201102                        eng     aEP59341997  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI14  aJ1510aDoes Multiracial Matter?

We assess whether the health status of adults who view themselves as multiracial is distinctive from that of adults who maintain a single-race identity, by using a seven-year (2001-2007) pooled sample of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). We explore racial differences in self-rated health between whites and several single and multiracial adults with binary logistic regression analyses and investigate whether placing these groups into a self-reported "best race" category alters patterns of health disparities. We propose four hypotheses that predict how the self-rated health status of specific multiracial groups compares with their respective component single-race counterparts, and we find substantial complexity in that no one explanatory model applies to all multiracial combinations. We also find that placing multiracial groups into a single "best race" category likely obscures the pattern of health disparities for selected groups because some multiracial adults (e.g., American Indians) tend to identify with single-race groups whose health experience they do not share. 4aHealth and Inequality         b(I14) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aHealth  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g48g1h127-52tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275943&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201102710naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450128001751000014003037000014003171100009003317100021003405201407003616500038017686500076018066500155018826510010020376530014020476530012020616530015020736550020020887730030021088560006021388560198021449030018023421275944  a201201       201102                        eng     aEP59341999  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aP3613aThe Effects of Childhood, Adult, and Community Socioeconomic Conditions on Health and Mortality among Older Adults in China10aWen, Ming10aGu, Danan  aU UT  aUN, New York, NY  aUsing a large, nationally representative longitudinal sample of Chinese aged 65 and older, this study examines the effects of childhood, adult, and community socioeconomic conditions on mortality and several major health outcomes. The role of social mobility is also tested. We find that childhood socioeconomic conditions exert long-term effects on functional limitations, cognitive impairment, self-rated health, and mortality independent of adult and community socioeconomic conditions. Achieved conditions matter for most outcomes as well, considering that adult and community socioeconomic conditions have additional impacts on health among Chinese elders. The majority of the effects of childhood conditions are not mediated by adult and community conditions. The results also show that social mobility and health in later life are linked in complex ways and that psychosocial factors have marginal explanatory power for the effects of socioeconomic conditions. Overall, this study provides new longitudinal evidence from China to support the notion that health and mortality at older ages are influenced by long-term and dynamic processes structured by the social stratification system. We discuss our findings in the context of the life course and ecological perspective, emphasizing that human development is influenced by a nexus of social experiences that impact individuals throughout life. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36)  aChina  aChildhood  a Health  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g48g1h153-81tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275944&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201102548naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450091001751000018002667000021002847000019003051100013003247100009003377100014003465201200003606500038015606500108015986500065017066510014017716530012017856530012017976530013018096530015018226530015018376530013018526550020018657730031018858560006019168560198019229030018021201275945  a201201       201102                        eng     aEP59341987  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ14  aJ6113aThe Effects of Children's Migration on Elderly Kin's Health: A Counterfactual Approach10aKuhn, Randall10aEverett, Bethany10aSilvey, Rachel  aU Denver  aU CO  aU Toronto  aRecent studies of migration and the left-behind have found that elders with migrant children actually experience better health outcomes than those with no migrant children, yet these studies raise many concerns about self-selection. Using three rounds of panel survey data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey, we employ the counterfactual framework developed by Rosenbaum and Rubin to examine the relationship between having a migrant child and the health of elders aged 50 and older, as measured by activities of daily living (ADL), self-rated health (SRH), and mortality. As in earlier studies, we find a positive association between old-age health and children's migration, an effect that is partly explained by an individual's propensity to have migrant children. Positive impacts of migration are much greater among elders with a high propensity to have migrant children than among those with low propensity. We note that migration is one of the single greatest sources of health disparity among the elders in our study population, and point to the need for research and policy aimed at broadening the benefits of migration to better improve health systems rather than individual health. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aIndonesia  aElderly  a Health  a Migrant  a Migration  a Mortality  a Old Age  aJournal Article  g48g1h183-209tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275945&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201103045naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450115001671000028002827000023003107000016003337000018003497000021003671100059003887100059004477100059005067100059005657100059006245201462006836500038021456500042021836510023022256530011022486530013022596530012022726530019022846530015023036530021023186550020023397730030023598560006023898560198023959030018025931275946  a201201       201102                        eng     aEP59341985  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aI1410aLosses of Expected Lifetime in the United States and Other Developed Countries: Methods and Empirical Analyses10aShkolnikov, Vladimir M.10aAndreev, Evgeny M.10aZhang, Zhen10aOeppen, James10aVaupel, James W.  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock  aPatterns of diversity in age at death are examined using e[superscript cross], a dispersion measure that equals the average expected lifetime lost at death. We apply two methods for decomposing differences in e[superscript cross]. The first method estimates the contributions of average levels of mortality and mortality age structures. The second (and newly developed) method returns components produced by differences between age- and cause-specific mortality rates. The United States is close to England and Wales in mean life expectancy but has higher life expectancy losses and lacks mortality compression. The difference is determined by mortality age structures, whereas the role of mortality levels is minor. This is related to excess mortality at ages under 65 from various causes in the United States. Regression on 17 country-series suggests that e[superscript cross] correlates with income inequality across countries but not across time. This result can be attributed to dissimilarity between the age- and cause-of-death structures of temporal mortality reduction and intercountry mortality variation. It also suggests that factors affecting overall mortality decrease differ from those responsible for excess lifetime losses in the United States compared with other countries. The latter can be related to weaknesses of health system and other factors resulting in premature death from heart diseases, amenable causes, accidents, and violence. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth and Inequality         b(I14)  aSelected Countries  aDeaths  a Disease  a Health  a Heart Disease  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  aJournal Article  g48g1h211-39tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275946&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201102231naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450078001751000017002537000019002707000017002891100036003067100063003427100012004055200881004176500042012986500108013406500113014486510009015616530015015706530012015856550020015977730030016178560006016478560198016539030018018511275947  a201201       201102                        eng     aEP59341998  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI14  aJ14  aJ1510aDisability among Native-Born and Foreign-Born Blacks in the United States10aElo, Irma T.10aMehta, Neil K.10aHuang, Cheng  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aCenter for Social Epidemiology and Population Health, U MI  aEmory U  aUsing the 5% Public Use Micro Data Sample (PUMS) from the 2000 U.S. census, we examine differences in disability among eight black subgroups distinguished by place of birth and Hispanic ethnicity.

Three predictions from the SM theory are tested by examining the age dependence of mortality patterns for 42 countries (including developed and developing countries) over the period 1955-2003. By applying finite mixture regression models, principal component analysis, and random-effects panel regression models, we find that (1) the negative correlation between the initial adulthood mortality rate and the rate of increase in mortality with age derived in the SM theory exists but is not constant; (2) within the SM framework, the implied age of expected zero vitality (expected maximum survival age) also is variable over time; (3) longevity trajectories are not homogeneous among the countries; (4) Central American and Southeast Asian countries have higher expected age of zero vitality than other countries in spite of relatively disadvantageous national ecological systems; (5) within the group of Central American and Southeast Asian countries, a more disadvantageous national ecological system is associated with a higher expected age of zero vitality; and (6) larger agricultural and food productivities, higher labor participation rates, higher percentages of population living in urban areas, and larger GDP per capita and GDP per unit of energy use are important beneficial national ecological system factors that can promote survival. These findings indicate that the SM theory needs to be generalized to incorporate heterogeneity among human populations. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aSelected Countries  aAging  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  a Population  aJournal Article  g48g1h267-90tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275948&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S6%2BWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201102694naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450070001751000021002451100021002665201415002876500076017026500066017786500155018446510010019996530010020096530011020196530014020306530015020446530014020596550020020737730031020938560006021248560196021309030018023261275949  a201201       201102                        eng     aEP59341993  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ16  aP3610aChild Underreporting, Fertility, and Sex Ratio Imbalance in China10aGoodkind, Daniel  aUS Census Bureau  aChild underreporting is often neglected in studies of fertility and sex ratio imbalance in China. To improve estimates of these measures, I use intercensal comparisons to identify a rise in underreporting, which followed the increased enforcement and penalization under the birth planning system in 1991. A new triangulation of evidence indicates that about 19% of children at ages 0-4 were unreported in the 2000 census, more than double that of the 1990 census. This evidence contradicts assumptions underlying the fertility estimates of most recent studies. Yet, the analysis also suggests that China's fertility in the late 1990s (and perhaps beyond) was below officially adjusted levels. I then conduct a similar intercensal analysis of sex ratios of births and children, which are the world's highest primarily because of prenatal sex selection. However, given excess underreporting of young daughters, especially pronounced just after 1990, estimated ratios are lower than reported ratios. Sex ratios in areas with a "1.5-child" policy are especially distorted because of excess daughter underreporting, as well as sex-linked stopping rules and other factors, although it is unclear whether such policies increase use of prenatal sex selection. China's sex ratio at birth, once it is standardized by birth order, fell between 2000 and 2005 and showed a continuing excess in urban China, not rural China. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36)  aChina  aBirth  a Child  a Children  a Fertility  a Prenatal  aJournal Article  g48g1h291-316tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275949&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201102376naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450097001671000028002647000024002921100059003167100009003755201084003846500084014686500076015526510023016286530010016516530018016616530018016796530015016976530013017126530019017256550020017447730030017648560006017948560196018009030018019961275950  a201201       201102                        eng     aEP59341986  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aNonmarital Childbearing in Russia: Second Demographic Transition or Pattern of Disadvantage?20aPerelli-Harris, Brienna10aGerber, Theodore P.  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock  aU WI  aUsing retrospective union, birth, and education histories that span 1980-2003, this study investigates nonmarital childbearing in contemporary Russia. We employ a combination of methods to decompose fertility rates by union status and analyze the processes that lead to a nonmarital birth. We find that the increase in the percentage of nonmarital births was driven mainly by the growing proportion of women who cohabit before conception, not changing fertility behavior of cohabitors or changes in union behavior after conception. The relationship between education and nonmarital childbearing has remained stable: the least-educated women have the highest birth rates within cohabitation and as single mothers, primarily because of their lower probability of legitimating a nonmarital conception. These findings suggest that nonmarital childbearing Russia has more in common with the pattern of disadvantage in the United States than with the second demographic transition. We also find several aspects of nonmarital childbearing that neither of these perspectives anticipates. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aRussian Federation  aBirth  a Childbearing  a Demographics  a Fertility  a Mothers  a Single Mother  aJournal Article  g48g1h317-42tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275950&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201102530naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450079001671000022002461100020002685201385002886500076016736500066017496510010018156530009018256530014018346530020018486530015018686530012018836530027018956550020019227730030019428560006019728560196019789030018021741275951  a201201       201102                        eng     aEP59341990  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1610aSon Preference in Indian Families: Absolute versus Relative Wealth Effects10aGaudin, Sylvestre  aOberlin College  aThe desire for male children is prevalent in India, where son preference has been shown to affect fertility behavior and intrahousehold allocation of resources. Economic theory predicts less gender discrimination in wealthier households, but demographers and sociologists have argued that wealth can exacerbate bias in the Indian context. I argue that these apparently conflicting theories can be reconciled and simultaneously tested if one considers that they are based on two different notions of wealth: one related to resource constraints (absolute wealth), and the other to notions of local status (relative wealth). Using cross-sectional data from the 1998-1999 and 2005-2006 National Family and Health Surveys, I construct measures of absolute and relative wealth by using principal components analysis. A series of statistical models of son preference is estimated by using multilevel methods. Results consistently show that higher absolute wealth is strongly associated with lower son preference, and the effect is 20%-40% stronger when the household's community-specific wealth score is included in the regression. Coefficients on relative wealth are positive and significant although lower in magnitude. Results are robust to using different samples, alternative groupings of households in local areas, different estimation methods, and alternative dependent variables. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aIndia  aBias  a Children  a Discrimination  a Fertility  a Gender  a Gender Discrimination  aJournal Article  g48g1h343-70tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275951&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201102420naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450097001751000020002721100019002925201106003116500077014176500099014946500167015936510009017606530021017696530018017906530016018086550020018247730030018448560006018748560196018809030018020761275952  a201201       201102                        eng     aEP59341992  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aQ53  aQ5613aThe Leverage of Demographic Dynamics on Carbon Dioxide Emissions: Does Age Structure Matter?10aZagheni, Emilio  aU CA, Berkeley  aThis article provides a methodological contribution to the study of the effect of changes in population age structure on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. First, I propose a generalization of the IPAT equation to a multisector economy with an age-structured population and discuss the insights that can be obtained in the context of stable population theory. Second, I suggest a statistical model of household consumption as a function of household size and age structure to quantitatively evaluate the extent of economies of scale in consumption of energy-intensive goods, and to estimate age-specific profiles of consumption of energy-intensive goods and of CO2 emissions. Third, I offer an illustration of the methodologies using data for the United States. The analysis shows that per-capita CO2 emissions increase with age until the individual is in his or her 60s, and then emissions tend to decrease. Holding everything else constant, the expected change in U.S. population age distribution during the next four decades is likely to have a small, but noticeable, positive impact on CO2 emissions. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aAir Pollution; Water Pollution; Noise; Hazardous Waste; Solid Waste; Recycling         b(Q53) 4aEnvironment and Development; Environment and Trade; Sustainability; Environmental Accounts and Accounting; Environmental Equity; Population Growth         b(Q56)  aU.S.  aAge Distribution  a Demographics  a Population  aJournal Article  g48g1h371-99tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1275952&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201102540naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450103001671000022002707000021002921100055003137100055003685201259004236500063016826500172017456510009019176530014019266530016019406550020019567730030019768560006020068560196020129030018022081150888  a201102       201011                        eng     aEP55666945  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aQ54  aR2310aGoing Home after Hurricane Katrina: Determinants of Return Migration and Changes in Affected Areas10aGroen, Jeffrey A.10aPolivka, Anne E.  aBureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor  aBureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor  aThis article examines the decision of Hurricane Katrina evacuees to return to their pre-Katrina areas and documents how the composition of the Katrina-affected region changed over time. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we show that an evacuee's age, family income, and the severity of damage in an evacuee's county of origin are important determinants of whether an evacuee returned during the first year after the storm. Blacks were less likely to return than whites, but this difference is primarily related to the geographical pattern of storm damage rather than to race per se. The difference between the composition of evacuees who returned and the composition of evacuees who did not return is the primary force behind changes in the composition of the affected areas in the first two years after the storm. Katrina is associated with substantial shifts in the racial composition of the affected areas (namely, a decrease in the percentage of residents who are black) and an increasing presence of Hispanics. Katrina is also associated with an increase in the percentage of older residents, a decrease in the percentage of residents with low income/education, and an increase in the percentage of residents with high income/education. 4aClimate; Natural Disasters; Global Warming         b(Q54) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aMigration  a Population  aJournal Article  g47g4h821-44tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1150888&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201002881naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450130001751000023003051100036003285201293003646500113016576500102017706500172018726510009020446530011020536530019020646530013020836530016020966530015021126530016021276530016021436530012021596530017021716530013021886550020022017730030022218560006022518560196022579030018024531150889  a201102       201011                        eng     aEP55666946  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aR21  aR2313aThe Spatial Dynamics of Stratification: Metropolitan Context, Population Redistribution, and Black and Hispanic Homeownership10aFlippen, Chenoa A.  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aRacial and ethnic inequality in homeownership remains stubbornly wide, even net of differences across groups in household-level sociodemographic characteristics. This article investigates the role of contextual forces in structuring disparate access to homeownership among minorities. Specifically, I combine household- and metropolitan-level census data to assess the impact of metropolitan housing stock, minority composition, and residential segregation on black and Hispanic housing tenure. The measure of minority composition combines both the size and rate of growth of the coethnic population to assess the impact on homeownership inequality of recent trends in population redistribution, particularly the increase in black migration to the South and dramatic dispersal of Hispanics outside traditional areas of settlement. Results indicate remarkable similarity between blacks and Hispanics with respect to the spatial and contextual influences on homeownership. For both groups, homeownership is higher and inequality with whites is smaller in metropolitan areas with an established coethnic base and in areas in which their group is less residentially segregated. Implications of recent trends in population redistribution for the future of minority homeownership are discussed. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand         b(R21) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Homeownership  a Housing  a Inequality  a Migration  a Minorities  a Population  a Racial  a Residential  a Spatial  aJournal Article  g47g4h845-68tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1150889&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201002783naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450066001751000018002417000022002591100015002817100018002965201363003146500084016776500113017616500172018746510009020466530011020556530014020666530010020806530012020906530013021026530012021156550020021277730030021478560006021778560196021839030018023791150890  a201102       201011                        eng     aEP55666947  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ15  aR2313aThe Residential Segregation of Mixed-Nativity Married Couples10aIceland, John10aNelson, Kyle Anne  aPA State U  aU Northern CO  aThis article examines the ways in which mixed-nativity marriage is related to spatial assimilation in metropolitan areas of the United States. Specifically, we examine the residential patterns of households with a mixed-nativity--and, in some cases, interracial--marriage to determine whether they are less segregated from the native-born than entirely foreign-born households. Using restricted-use data from the 2000 census, we find that compared with couples in which both spouses are foreign-born, mixed-nativity couples tend to be less segregated from various native-born racial and ethnic groups. Further, among both foreign-born Asians and Hispanics, those with a native-born non-Hispanic white spouse are considerably less segregated from native-born white households than from other foreign-born Asian and Hispanic households. We also find that even though nativity status matters for black couples in a manner consistent with assimilation theory, foreign-born and mixed-nativity black households still each display very high levels of segregation from all other native-born racial/ethnic groups, reaffirming the power of race in determining residential patterns. Overall, our findings provide moderate support for spatial assimilation theory and suggest that cross-nativity marriages often facilitate the residential integration of the foreign-born. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Marriage  a Race  a Racial  a Spatial  a Spouse  aJournal Article  g47g4h869-93tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1150890&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201002195naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450030001671000018001977000017002151100015002327100016002475201072002636500076013356500084014116510009014956530012015046530014015166530017015306530010015476530017015576550020015747730031015948560006016258560196016319030018018271150891  a201102       201011                        eng     aEP55666948  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD81  aJ1210aDivorce as Risky Behavior10aLight, Audrey10aAhn, Taehyun  aOH State U  aKyung Hee U  aGiven that divorce often represents a high-stakes income gamble, we ask how individual levels of risk tolerance affect the decision to divorce. We extend the orthodox divorce model by assuming that individuals are risk averse, that marriage is risky, and that divorce is even riskier. The model predicts that conditional on the expected gains to marriage and divorce, the probability of divorce increases with relative risk tolerance because risk averse individuals require compensation for the additional risk that is inherent in divorce. To implement the model empirically, we use data for first-married women and men from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to estimate a probit model of divorce in which a measure of risk tolerance is among the covariates. The estimates reveal that a 1-point increase in risk tolerance raises the predicted probability of divorce by 4.3% for a representative man and by 11.4% for a representative woman. These findings are consistent with the notion that divorce entails a greater income gamble for women than for men. 4aCriteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty         b(D81) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aDivorce  a Marriage  a Probability  a Risk  a Risk Averse  aJournal Article  g47g4h895-921tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1150891&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201002131naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450059001591000028002187000022002461100011002687100107002795201043003866500076014296510011015056530010015166530018015266530015015446550020015597730030015798560006016098560196016159030018018111150892  a201102       201011                        eng     aEP55666949  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aDo Siblings' Fertility Decisions Influence Each Other?10aLyngstad, Torkild Hovde10aPrskawetz, Alexia  aU Oslo  aInstitute of Mathematical Methods in Economics, Vienna U Technology and Vienna Institute of Demography  aIndividuals' fertility decisions are shaped not only by their own characteristics and life course paths but also by social interaction with others. However, in practice, it is difficult to disentangle the role of social interaction from other factors, such as individual and family background variables. We measure social interaction through the cross-sibling influences on fertility. Continuous-time hazard models are estimated separately for women's first and second births. In addition to individual socioeconomic variables, demographic variables, and an unobserved factor specific to each sibling pair, siblings' birth events and their timing enter as time-varying covariates. We use data from longitudinal population-wide Norwegian administrative registers. The data cover more than 110,000 sibling pairs and include the siblings' fertility, education, income, and marital histories. Our results indicate that cross-sibling influences are relatively strong for the respondents' first births but weak for the second parity transition. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aNorway  aBirth  a Demographics  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g47g4h923-34tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1150892&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201003070naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450038001671000018002057000023002237000019002467000020002651100023002857100015003087100015003237100017003385201737003556500066020926500065021586510012022236530017022356530012022526530012022646530016022766530029022926530015023216530019023366530011023556550020023667730030023868560006024168560196024229030018026181150893  a201102       201011                        eng     aEP55666950  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aJ6110aGender and Migration from Albania10aStecklov, Guy10aCarletto, Calogero10aAzzarri, Carlo10aDavis, Benjamin  aHebrew U Jerusalem  aWorld Bank  aWorld Bank  aUNICEF-ESARO  aThis article examines the dynamics and causes of the shift in the gender composition of migration, and more particularly, in women's access to migration opportunities and decision-making. Our analysis focuses on Albania, a natural laboratory for studying international migration where outmigration was essentially nonexistent from the end of World War II to the end of the 1980s. Interest in the Albanian case is heightened because of the complex layers of inequality existing at the time when migration began: relatively low levels of inequality within the labor market and educational system's product of the Communist era--while household relations remained heavily steeped in tradition and patriarchy. We use micro-level data from the Albania 2005 Living Standards Measurement Study, including migration histories for family members since migration began. Based on discrete-time hazard models, the analysis shows a dramatic increase in male migration and a gradual and uneven expansion of the female proportion of this international migration. Female migration, which is shown to be strongly associated with education, wealth, and social capital, appears responsive to economic incentives and constraints. Using information on the dependency of female migration to the household demographic structure as well as the sensitivity of female migration to household-level shocks, we show how household-level constraints and incentives affect male and female migration differently. Throughout this period, however, women's migration behavior appears more directly aligned with household-level factors, and there is little evidence to suggest that increased female migration signals rising behavioral independence among Albanian women. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aAlbania  aDemographics  a Female  a Gender  a Inequality  a International Migration  a Migration  a Out Migration  a Women  aJournal Article  g47g4h935-61tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1150893&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201002787naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450092001831000018002757000017002931100009003107100009003195201266003286500071015946500084016656500076017496500155018256510010019806530010019906530016020006530012020166530012020286530025020406530016020656530014020816550020020957730030021158560006021458560196021519030018023471150894  a201102       201011                        eng     aEP55666951  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD13  aJ12  aJ13  aP3610aFamily Life Course Transitions and Rural Household Economy during China's Market Reform10aChen, Feinian10aKorinek, Kim  aU MD  aU UT  aThis article investigates the effect of family life course transitions on labor allocation strategies in rural Chinese households. We highlight three types of economic activity that involve reallocation of household labor oriented toward a more diversified, nonfarm rural economy: involvement in wage employment, household entrepreneurship, and/or multiple activities that span economic sectors. With the use of data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS 1997, 2000, and 2004), our longitudinal analyses of rural household economic activity point to the significance of household demography, life course transitions, and local economic structures as factors facilitating household labor reallocation. First, as expected, a relatively youthful household structure is conducive to innovative economic behavior. Second, household entrances and exits are significant, but their impacts are not equal. Life events such as births, deaths, marriage, or leaving home for school or employment affect household economy in distinctive ways. Finally, the reallocations of household labor undertaken by households are shaped by local economic structures: in particular, the extent of village-level entrepreneurial activity, off-farm employment, and out-migration. 4aHousehold Production and Intrahousehold Allocation         b(D13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36)  aChina  aBirth  a Demography  a Family  a Health  a Household Economics  a Households  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g47g4h963-87tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1150894&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201002290naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450049001911000024002407000016002641100015002807100029002955200789003246500077011136500066011906500170012566500049014266500098014756510010015736530011015836530012015946530014016066550020016207730032016408560006016728560196016789030018018741150895  a201102       201011                        eng     aEP55666952  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ16  aN35  aZ12  aZ1310aKinship Institutions and Sex Ratios in India10aChakraborty, Tanika10aKim, Sukkoo  aDIW Berlin  aWashington U in St Louis  aThis article explores the relationship between kinship institutions and sex ratios in India at the turn of the twentieth century. Because kinship rules vary by caste, language, religion, and region, we construct sex ratios by these categories at the district level by using data from the 1901 Census of India for Punjab (North), Bengal (East), and Madras (South). We find that the male-to-female sex ratio varied positively with caste rank, fell as one moved from the North to the East and then to the South, was higher for Hindus than for Muslims, and was higher for northern Indo-Aryan speakers than for the southern Dravidian-speaking people. We argue that these systematic patterns in the data are consistent with variations in the institution of family, kinship, and inheritance. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Asia including Middle East         b(N35) 4aCultural Economics: Religion         b(Z12) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aIndia  aCensus  a Female  a Religion  aJournal Article  g47g4h989-1012tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1150895&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201002861naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450102001831000016002857000023003017000021003241100021003457100088003667100021004545201247004756500084017226500076018066500160018826500098020426510016021406530011021566530014021676530011021816550020021927730031022128560006022438560196022499030018024451150896  a201102       201011                        eng     aEP55666953  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ13  aN33  aZ1310aStandardization of Pathways to Adulthood?

Although largely overlooked by previous studies, theory suggests that life courses of young adults born during this period were already influenced by a process of standardization, in the sense that their life courses became more similar over time. Using data from a Dutch registry-based sample, we examine household trajectories: that is, sequences of living arrangements of young adults aged 15-40. Our study shows that for successive cohorts, household trajectories became more similar. We identified six types of trajectories: early death, life-cycle service, early family formation, late family formation, singlehood, and childless but with partner. Over time, early family formation gradually became the "standard" trajectory to adulthood. However, late family formation and singlehood, common pathways within the preindustrial western European marriage pattern, remained widespread among cohorts born in the late nineteenth century. Laboring class youths, farmers' daughters, young people of mixed religious background, and urban-born youngsters were the nineteenth century forerunners of a standard pathway to adulthood. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Europe: Pre-1913         b(N33) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aNetherlands  aFamily  a Marriage  a Youth  aJournal Article  g47g4h1013-34tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1150896&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201002832naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450126001911000020003177000020003371100108003577100032004655201188004976500064016856500092017496500052018416500073018936500113019666510009020796530011020886530022020996530018021216530012021396550020021517730031021718560006022028560196022089030018024041150897  a201102       201011                        eng     aEP55666954  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aH51  aH75  aI11  aI18  aJ1510aUnhealthy and Uninsured: Exploring Racial Differences in Health and Health Insurance Coverage Using a Life Table Approach10aKirby, James B.10aKaneda, Toshiko  aAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality-Center for Financing, Access, and Cost Trends, Rockville, MD  aPopulation Reference Bureau  aMillions of people in the United States do not have health insurance, and wide racial and ethnic disparities exist in coverage. Current research provides a limited description of this problem, focusing on the number or proportion of individuals without insurance at a single time point or for a short period. Moreover, the literature provides no sense of the joint risk of being uninsured and in need of medical care. In this article, we use a life table approach to calculate health- and insurance-specific life expectancies for whites and blacks, thereby providing estimates of the duration of exposure to different insurance and health states over a typical lifetime. We find that, on average, Americans can expect to spend well over a decade without health insurance during a typical lifetime and that 40% of these years are spent in less-healthy categories. Findings also reveal a significant racial gap: despite their shorter overall life expectancy, blacks have a longer uninsured life expectancy than whites, and this racial gap consists entirely of less-healthy years. Racial disparities in insurance coverage are thus likely more severe than indicated by previous research. 4aNational Government Expenditures and Health         b(H51) 4aState and Local Government: Health; Education; Welfare; Public Pensions         b(H75) 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aHealth  a Health Insurance  a Medical Care  a Racial  aJournal Article  g47g4h1035-51tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1150897&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201002748naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450153001751000020003287000020003481100016003687100024003845201419004086500148018276500054019756500038020296510009020676530020020766530015020966530016021116550020021277730031021478560006021788560196021849030018023801150898  a201102       201011                        eng     aEP55666955  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aC21  aC51  aI1210aObtaining Multistate Life Table Distributions for Highly Refined Subpopulations from Cross-Sectional Data: A Bayesian Extension of Sullivan's Method10aLynch, Scott M.10aBrown, J. Scott  aPrinceton U  aMiami U, Oxford, OH  aMultistate life table methods are often used to estimate the proportion of remaining life that individuals can expect to spend in various states, such as healthy and unhealthy states. Sullivan's method is commonly used when panels containing data on transitions are unavailable and true multistate tables cannot be generated. Sullivan's method requires only cross-sectional mortality data and cross-sectional data indicating prevalence in states of interest. Such data often come from sample surveys, which are widely available. Although the data requirements for Sullivan's method are minimal, the method is limited in its ability to produce estimates for subpopulations because of limited disaggregation of data in cross-sectional mortality files and small cell sizes in aggregated survey data. In this article, we develop, test, and demonstrate a method that adapts Sullivan's approach to allow the inclusion of covariates in producing interval estimates of state expectancies for any desired subpopulation that can be specified in the cross-sectional prevalence data. The method involves a three-step process: (1) using Gibbs sampling to sample parameters from a bivariate regression model; (2) using ecological inference for producing transition probability matrices from the Gibbs samples; (3) using standard multistate calculations to convert the transition probability matrices into multistate life tables. 4aSingle Equation Models; Single Variables: Cross-Sectional Models; Spatial Models; Treatment Effect Models; Quantile Regressions         b(C21) 4aModel Construction and Estimation         b(C51) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aCross Sectional  a Mortality  a Regression  aJournal Article  g47g4h1053-77tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1150898&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 201000475naa  2200133   4500001001100000008004400011022001300055245002600068655001200094773000700106856000600113856019900119903002300318EP55249602       201008                        eng     a0070337010aNOTE FROM THE EDITOR.  aArticle  g47  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=EP55249602&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAug2010 Supplement00464naa  2200133   4500001001100000008004400011022001300055245001300068655002200081773001000103856000600113856019900119903001200318EP53070088       201008                        eng     a0070337010aERRATUM.  aCorrection notice  g47g3  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=EP53070088&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAug201002801naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450111001831000020002947000017003141100056003317100009003875201309003966500084017056500108017896500109018976500155020066510010021616530012021716550020021837730030022038560006022338560196022399030016024351132033  a201010       201008                        eng     aEP53070089  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ14  aO15  aP3610aShifting Coresidence Near the End of Life: Comparing Decedents and Survivors of a Follow-Up Study in China10aZimmer, Zachary10aKorinek, Kim  aInstitute of Public and International Affairs, U UT  aU UT  aWhat we know about transitions in coresidence of elders in China is based on panel data involving survivors. This article examines the tendency to and determinants of shifts in coresidence with adult children among the very old, comparing survivors of an intersurvey period with those who died (decedents). Data come from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Baseline and follow-up surveys indicate shifts in coresidence, defined as change from not living with an adult child to living in the same household as an adult child, and the converse. Rates of shifting are adjusted for time to follow-up. Regressions examine predictors of shifts among four groups: baseline coresident and noncoresident survivors and decedents. Decedents and noncoresidents are more likely to shift than survivors and coresidents. Covariates related to physical and material need as well as marital status are the strongest predictors of shift. Thus, the needs of a very old person dominate coresidential shifts and stability, lending support to an altruistic notion of living arrangement decision making. In the end, we conclude that the period nearing the end of life is a time of flux in living situation and that coresidential shifts are underestimated when those who die during a follow-up study are ignored. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36)  aChina  aMarital  aJournal Article  g47g3h537-54tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1132033&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201002693naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450081001671000023002487000024002717000026002957000024003211100009003457100009003547100014003637100017003775201458003946500038018526500066018906510009019566530011019656530012019766530015019886530013020036530011020166550020020277730030020478560006020778560196020839030016022791132034  a201010       201008                        eng     aEP53070090  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1610aSocial, Behavioral, and Biological Factors, and Sex Differences in Mortality10aRogers, Richard G.10aEverett, Bethany G.10aSaint Onge, Jarron M.10aKrueger, Patrick M.  aU CO  aU CO  aU Houston  aU CO, Denver  aFew studies have examined whether sex differences in mortality are associated with different distributions of risk factors or result from the unique relationships between risk factors and mortality for men and women. We extend previous research by systematically testing a variety of factors, including health behaviors, social ties, socioeconomic status, and biological indicators of health. We employ the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey III Linked Mortality File and use Cox proportional hazards models to examine sex differences in adult mortality in the United States. Our findings document that social and behavioral characteristics are key factors related to the sex gap in mortality. Once we control for women's lower levels of marriage, poverty, and exercise, the sex gap in mortality widens; and once we control for women's greater propensity to visit with friends and relatives, attend religious services, and abstain from smoking, the sex gap in mortality narrows. Biological factors--including indicators of inflammation and cardiovascular risk--also inform sex differences in mortality. Nevertheless, persistent sex differences in mortality remain: compared with women, men have 30% to 83% higher risks of death over the follow-up period, depending on the covariates included in the model. Although the prevalence of risk factors differs by sex, the impact of those risk factors on mortality is similar for men and women. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Health  a Mortality  a Smoking  a Women  aJournal Article  g47g3h555-78tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1132034&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201002231naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450116001671000013002837000018002967000019003147000028003331100024003617100009003857100019003947100014004135201035004276500038014626500066015006510009015666530011015756530015015866550020016017730030016218560006016518560196016579030016018531132035  a201010       201008                        eng     aEP53070091  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1610aPreliminary Evidence Regarding the Hypothesis That the Sex Ratio at Sexual Maturity May Affect Longevity in Men10aJin, Lei10aElwert, Felix10aFreese, Jeremy10aChristakis, Nicholas A.  aChinese U Hong Kong  aU WI  aNorthwestern U  aHarvard U  aIn human populations, variation in mate availability has been linked to various biological and social outcomes, but the possible effect of mate availability on health or survival has not been studied. Unbalanced sex ratios are a concern in many parts of the world, and their implications for the health and survival of the constituent individuals warrant careful investigation. We indexed mate availability with contextual sex ratios and investigated the hypothesis that the sex ratio at sexual maturity might be associated with long-term survival for men. Using two unique data sets of 7,683,462 and 4,183 men who were followed for more than 50 years, we found that men who reached their sexual maturity in an environment with higher sex ratios (i.e., higher proportions of reproductively ready men) appeared to suffer higher long-term mortality risks than those in an environment with lower sex ratios. Mate availability at sexual maturity may be linked via several biological and social mechanisms to long-term survival in men. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aHealth  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g47g3h579-86tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1132035&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201002462naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450084001751000025002591100017002845201309003016500077016106500038016876500064017256510009017896530011017986530019018096530015018286530012018436550020018557730031018758560006019068560196019129030016021081132036  a201010       201008                        eng     aEP53070092  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aH76  aI12  aK4210aIncarcerating Death: Mortality in U.S. State Correctional Facilities, 1985-199810aPatterson, Evelyn J.  aVanderbilt U  aUsing data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics and Census Bureau, I estimate death rates of working-age prisoners and nonprisoners by sex and race. Incarceration was more detrimental to females in comparison to their male counterparts in the period covered by this study. White male prisoners had higher death rates than white males who were not in prison. Black male prisoners, however, consistently exhibited lower death rates than black male nonprisoners did. Additionally, the findings indicate that while the relative difference in mortality levels of white and black males was quite high outside of prison, it essentially disappeared in prison. Notably, removing deaths caused by firearms and motor vehicles in the nonprison population accounted for some of the mortality differential between black prisoners and nonprisoners. The death rates of the other groups analyzed suggest that prison is an unhealthy environment; yet, prison appears to be a healthier place than the typical environment of the nonincarcerated black male population. These findings suggest that firearms and motor vehicle accidents do not sufficiently explain the higher death rates of black males, and they indicate that a lack of basic healthcare may be implicated in the death rates of black males not incarcerated. 4aState and Local Government: Other Expenditure Categories         b(H76) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aIllegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law         b(K42)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Incarceration  a Mortality  a Prison  aJournal Article  g47g3h587-607tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1132036&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201002573naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450122001751000019002977000021003161100050003377100013003875201330004006500068017306500053017986500052018516510009019036530016019126530016019286530011019446550020019557730030019758560006020058560196020119030016022071132037  a201010       201008                        eng     aEP53070093  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ21  aJ22  aJ2610aMeasuring Years of Inactivity, Years in Retirement, Time to Retirement, and Age at Retirement within the Markov Model10aSkoog, Gary R.10aCiecka, James E.  aDePaul U and Legal Econometrics, Glenview, IL  aDePaul U  aRetirement-related concepts are treated as random variables within Markov process models that capture multiple labor force entries and exits. The expected number of years spent outside of the labor force, expected years in retirement, and expected age at retirement are computed--all of which are of immense policy interest but have been heretofore reported with less precisely measured proxies. Expected age at retirement varies directly with a person's age; but even younger people can expect to retire at ages substantially older than those commonly associated with retirement, such as age 60, 62, or 65. Between 1970 and 2003, men allocated most of their increase in life expectancy to increased time in retirement, but women allocated most of their increased life expectancy to labor force activity. Although people can exit and reenter the labor force at older ages, most 65-year-old men who are active in the labor force will not reenter after they eventually exit. At age 65, the probability that those who are inactive will reenter the labor force at some future time is .38 for men and .27 for women. Life expectancy at exact ages is decomposed into the sum of the expected time spent active and inactive in the labor force, and also as the sum of the expected time to labor force separation and time in retirement. 4aLabor Force and Employment, Size, and Structure         b(J21) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aRetirement; Retirement Policies         b(J26)  aU.S.  aLabor Force  a Retirement  a Women  aJournal Article  g47g3h609-28tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1132037&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201002376naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450090001671000025002577000024002827000022003061100060003287100027003887100009004155201066004246500076014906500109015666510011016756530017016866530016017036530015017196530012017346550020017467730030017668560006017968560196018029030016019981132038  a201010       201008                        eng     aEP53070094  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO1510aKnox Meets Cox: Adapting Epidemiological Space-Time Statistics to Demographic Studies10aSchmertmann, Carl P.10aAssuncao, Renato M.10aPotter, Joseph E.  aCenter for Demography and Population Health, FL State U  aFederal U Minas Gerais  aU TX  aMany important questions and theories in demography focus on changes over time, and on how those changes differ over geographic and social space. Space-time analysis has always been important in studying fertility transitions, for example. However, demographers have seldom used formal statistical methods to describe and analyze time series of maps. One formal method, used widely in epidemiology, criminology, and public health, is Knox's space-time interaction test. In this article, we discuss the potential of the Knox test in demographic research and note some possible pitfalls. We demonstrate how to use familiar proportional hazards models to adapt the Knox test for demographic applications. These adaptations allow for nonrepeatable events and for the incorporation of structural variables that change in space and time. We apply the modified test to data on the onset of fertility decline in Brazil over 1960-2000 and show how the modified method can produce maps indicating where and when diffusion effects seem strongest, net of covariate effects. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBrazil  aDemographics  a Demography  a Fertility  a Health  aJournal Article  g47g3h629-50tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1132038&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201002994naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450100001911000019002911100032003105201395003426500038017376500073017756500109018486500119019576500172020766510011022486530012022596530015022716530015022866530016023016530011023176550020023287730030023488560006023788560196023849030016025801132039  a201010       201008                        eng     aEP53070095  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aI18  aO15  aO18  aR2310aNonresponse in Repeat Population-Based Voluntary Counseling and Testing for HIV in Rural Malawi10aObare, Francis  aPopulation Council, Nairobi  aDespite the increasing number of population-based surveys in sub-Saharan Africa that provide testing and counseling for HIV over the past decade, understanding the nature of nonresponse in these surveys, especially panel HIV surveys, is still limited. This article uses longitudinal HIV data collected from rural Malawi in 2004 and 2006 to examine nonresponse in repeat population-based testing. It shows that nonresponse in repeat testing led to significant bias in the estimates of HIV prevalence and to inconsistent conclusions about the predictors of HIV status. In contrast, previous cross-sectional analyses found that nonresponse does not significantly bias the estimates of HIV prevalence. The difference in conclusions from cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of nonresponse can be attributed to two factors: the different definitions of what constitutes nonresponse in both contexts, and the risk profiles of the missed populations. In particular, although refusal and temporary absence are the major sources of nonresponse in the cross-sectional contexts, attrition attributable to mortality and out-migration are additional sources of nonresponse in repeat testing. Evidence shows that out-migrants have higher HIV prevalence than nonmigrants, which could account for significant bias in the estimates of prevalence among participants in both tests observed in this study. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aMalawi  aMigrant  a Migration  a Mortality  a Population  a Rural  aJournal Article  g47g3h651-65tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1132039&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201002589naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450048001751000019002237000020002421100071002627100009003335201176003426500084015186500066016026500109016686510010017776530025017876530017018126530012018296530012018416530023018536530014018766530010018906530011019006550020019117730030019318560006019618560196019679030016021631132040  a201010       201008                        eng     aEP53070096  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ16  aO1510aGender Scripts and Age at Marriage in India10aDesai, Sonalde10aAndrist, Lester  aU MD and National Council for Applied Economic Research, New Delhi  aU MD  aResearch on marriage in developing countries has been somewhat narrow in scope because of both conceptual and data limitations. While the feminist literature recognizes marriage as a key institutional site for the production and reproduction of gender hierarchies, little is known about the processes through which this relationship operates. This article uses data from the newly collected India Human Development Survey 2005 for 27,365 ever-married women aged 25-49 to explore ways in which different dimensions of gender in Indian society shape the decisions regarding age at marriage. We explore the impact of three dimensions of gender: (1) economic factors, such as availability of wage employment, dowry expectations, and wedding expenses; (2) indicators of familial empowerment, such as women's role in household decision making and access to and control over resources; and (3) markers of gender performance, such as observance of purdah and male-female separation in the household. Results from hierarchical linear models confirm the importance of markers of gender performance but fail to demonstrate a large role for economic factors and familial empowerment. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aIndia  aDeveloping Countries  a Development  a Female  a Gender  a Human Development  a Marriage  a Wage  a Women  aJournal Article  g47g3h667-87tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1132040&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201002518naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450043001831000020002261100020002465201225002666500056014916500084015476500076016316500172017076510009018796530013018886530010019016550020019117730031019318560006019628560196019689030016021641132041  a201010       201008                        eng     aEP53070097  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI32  aJ12  aJ13  aR2310aEarly Teen Marriage and Future Poverty10aDahl, Gordon B.  aU CA, San Diego  aBoth early teen marriage and dropping out of high school have historically been associated with a variety of negative outcomes, including higher poverty rates throughout life. Are these negative outcomes due to preexisting differences, or do they represent the causal effect of marriage and schooling choices? To better understand the true personal and societal consequences, in this article, I use an instrumental variables (IV) approach that takes advantage of variation in state laws regulating the age at which individuals are allowed to marry, drop out of school, and begin work. The baseline IV estimate indicates that a woman who marries young is 31 percentage points more likely to live in poverty when she is older. Similarly, a woman who drops out of school is 11 percentage points more likely to be poor. The results are robust to a variety of alternative specifications and estimation methods, including limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimation and a control function approach. While grouped ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates for the early teen marriage variable are also large, OLS estimates based on individual-level data are small, consistent with a large amount of measurement error. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aMarriage  a Poor  aJournal Article  g47g3h689-718tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1132041&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201002005naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450081001591000022002401100071002625200930003336500084012636510009013476530011013566530013013676530025013806530014014056530016014196550020014357730030014558560006014858560196014919030016016871132042  a201010       201008                        eng     aEP53070098  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aReassessing the Link between Premarital Cohabitation and Marital Instability10aReinhold, Steffen  aMannheim Research Institute for the Economics of Aging, U Mannheim  aPremarital cohabitation has been found to be positively correlated with the likelihood of marital dissolution in the United States. To reassess this link, I estimate proportional hazard models of marital dissolution for first marriages by using pooled data from the 1988, 1995, and 2002 surveys of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). These results suggest that the positive relationship between premarital cohabitation and marital instability has weakened for more recent birth and marriage cohorts. Using multiple marital outcomes for a person to account for one source of unobserved heterogeneity, panel models suggest that cohabitation is not selective of individuals with higher risk of marital dissolution and may be a stabilizing factor for higher-order marriages. Further research with more recent data is needed to assess whether these results are statistical artifacts caused by data weaknesses in the NSFG. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aFamily  a Marital  a Marital Dissolution  a Marriage  a Premarital  aJournal Article  g47g3h719-33tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1132042&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201002292naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450070001751000027002451100009002725201122002816500065014036500084014686500098015526510009016506530012016596530013016716530014016846550020016987730030017188560006017488560196017549030016019501132043  a201010       201008                        eng     aEP53070099  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI20  aJ12  aZ1310aPathways to Educational Homogamy in Marital and Cohabiting Unions10aSchwartz, Christine R.  aU WI  aThere is considerable disagreement about whether cohabitors are more or less likely to be educationally homogamous than married couples. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, I reconcile many of the disparate findings of previous research by conducting a "stock and flow" analysis of assortative cohabitation and marriage. I find that cohabitors are less likely to be educationally homogamous than married couples overall, but these differences are not apparent when cohabiting and marital unions begin. Instead, the results suggest that differences in educational homogamy by union type are driven by selective exits from marriage and cohabitation rather than by differences in partner choice. Marriages that cross educational boundaries are particularly likely to end. The findings suggest that although cohabitors place greater emphasis on egalitarianism than married couples, this does not translate into greater educational homogamy. The findings are also consistent with a large body of research on cohabitation and divorce questioning the effectiveness of cohabitation as a trial marriage. 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aU.S.  aDivorce  a Marital  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g47g3h735-53tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1132043&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201001916naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450066001751000026002411100015002675200716002826500065009986500084010636500076011476510009012236530014012326530014012466530014012606530012012746530012012866550020012987730030013188560006013488560196013549030016015501132044  a201010       201008                        eng     aEP53070100  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI20  aJ12  aJ1310aNontraditional Families and Childhood Progress through School10aRosenfeld, Michael J.  aStanford U  aI use U.S. census data to perform the first large-sample, nationally representative tests of outcomes for children raised by same-sex couples.

Neighborhood economic status appears to be strongly associated with children's skills acquisition. 4aEquity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement         b(D63) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Family  a Gini  a Gini Coefficient  a Inequality  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g47g3h777-800tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1132045&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201002421naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450082001671000018002491100017002675201323002846500071016076500065016786510009017436530014017526530017017666530013017836530015017966530016018116550020018277730030018478560006018778560196018839030016020791132046  a201010       201008                        eng     aEP53070102  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ44  aJ6110aImmigrants and Natives in U.S. Science and Engineering Occupations, 1994-200610aSana, Mariano  aVanderbilt U  aBetween 1994 and 2006, the ratio of foreign-born scientists and engineers (FSE) to native scientists and engineers (NSE) doubled. I decompose this change into a migration effect (which accounts for migration in general), a proportional college effect (which accounts for the relative proportions of college graduates among migrant and native workers), and a proportional science and engineering (S&E) effect (which accounts for the relative proportions of S&Es among migrant and native college-educated workers). Results show that the migration effect explains about three-quarters of the increase in FSE/NSE during the entire period under study. The proportional S&E effect, which captures changes in the ratio as a result of immigration of S&Es in excess of what would be expected from general migration alone, was largest in 1995-1998, which were years of sustained economic growth. Conversely, a slower economy coincided with a declining proportional S&E effect after 2000. Increases in the annual cap on H-1B visas, an important avenue of entry for foreign-born S&Es, had little effect on the ratio. In short, during 1994-2006, the association between economic swings and the specific, more than proportional migration of S&Es was much stronger than the association between the latter and changes in the H-1B cap. 4aProfessional Labor Markets; Occupational Licensing         b(J44) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  a Immigration  a Migrant  a Migration  a Occupation  aJournal Article  g47g3h801-20tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1132046&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 201002282naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450066001751000025002417000020002661100014002867100019003005201082003196500077014016500052014786500083015306510009016136530011016226530018016336530016016516550020016677730030016878560006017178560196017239030013019191110719  a201007       201005                        eng     aEP51701425  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ26  aK4910aRetirement and Death in Office of U.S. Supreme Court Justices10aStolzenberg, Ross M.10aLindgren, James  aU Chicago  aNorthwestern U  aWe construct demographic models of retirement and death in office of U.S. Supreme Court justices, a group that has gained demographic notice, evaded demographic analysis, and is said to diverge from expected retirement patterns. Models build on prior multistate labor force status studies, and data permit an unusually clear distinction between voluntary and "induced" retirement. Using data on every justice from 1789 through 2006, with robust, cluster-corrected, discrete-time, censored, event-history methods, we (1) estimate retirement effects of pension eligibility, age, health, and tenure on the timing of justices' retirements and deaths in office, (2) resolve decades of debate over the politicized departure hypothesis that justices tend to alter the timing of their retirements for the political benefit or detriment of the incumbent president, (3) reconsider the nature of rationality in retirement decisions, and (4) consider the relevance of organizational conditions as well as personal circumstances to retirement decisions. Methodological issues are addressed. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aRetirement; Retirement Policies         b(J26) 4aLegal Procedure, the Legal System, and Illegal Behavior: Other         b(K49)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Demographics  a Retirement  aJournal Article  g47g2h269-98tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1110719&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201002113naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450063001671000027002301100020002575201079002776500051013566500077014076510023014846530010015076530012015176530016015296550020015457730031015658560006015968560196016029030013017981110720  a201007       201005                        eng     aEP51701426  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ10  aJ1110aThree Measures of Longevity: Time Trends and Record Values20aCanudas-Romo, Vladimir  aJohns Hopkins U  aThis article examines the trend over time in the measures of "typical" longevity experienced by members of a population: life expectancy at birth, and the median and modal ages at death. The article also analyzes trends in record values observed for all three measures. The record life expectancy at birth increased from a level of 44 years in Sweden in 1840 to 82 years in Japan in 2005. The record median age at death shows increasing patterns similar to those observed in life expectancy at birth. However, the record modal age at death changes very little until the second half of the twentieth century: it moved from a plateau level, around age 80, to having a similar pace of increase as that observed for the mean and the median in most recent years. These findings explain the previously observed uninterrupted increase in the record life expectancy. The cause of this increase has changed over time from a dominance of child mortality reductions to a dominance of adult mortality reductions, which became evident by studying trends in the record modal age at death. 4aDemographic Economics: General         b(J10) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aSelected Countries  aBirth  a Deaths  a Population  aJournal Article  g47g2h299-312tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1110720&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201002424naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450065001751000018002401100016002585201226002746500077015006500084015776500066016616510012017276530017017396530014017566530016017706530012017866530011017986550020018097730030018298560006018598560196018659030013020611110721  a201007       201005                        eng     aEP51701427  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ12  aJ1610aHow Does the Age Gap between Partners Affect Their Survival?10aDrefahl, Sven  aU Stockholm  aI use hazard regression methods to examine how the age difference between spouses affects their survival. In many countries, the age difference between spouses at marriage has remained relatively stable for several decades. In Denmark, men are, on average, about three years older than the women they marry. Previous studies of the age gap between spouses with respect to mortality found that having a younger spouse is beneficial, while having an older spouse is detrimental for one's own survival. Most of the observed effects could not be explained satisfactorily until now, mainly because of methodological drawbacks and insufficiency of the data. The most common explanations refer to selection effects, caregiving in later life, and some positive psychological and sociological effects of having a younger spouse. The present study extends earlier work by using longitudinal Danish register data that include the entire history of key demographic events of the whole population from 1990 onward. Controlling for confounding factors such as education and wealth, results suggest that having a younger spouse is beneficial for men but detrimental for women, while having an older spouse is detrimental for both sexes. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aDenmark  aDemographics  a Marriage  a Population  a Spouse  a Women  aJournal Article  g47g2h313-26tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1110721&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201002346naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450041001751000016002167000020002327000019002521100066002717100066003377100066004035200920004696500038013896500077014276500076015046510009015806530010015896530011015996530014016106530013016246530018016376530016016556550020016717730030016918560006017218560196017279030013019231110722  a201007       201005                        eng     aEP51701428  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ11  aJ1310aSocial Demographic Change and Autism10aLiu, Kayuet10aZerubavel, Noam10aBearman, Peter  aPaul F.

Lazarsfeld Center for the Social Sciences, Columbia U  aParental age at child's birth--which has increased for U.S. children in the 1992-2000 birth cohorts--is strongly associated with an increased risk of autism. By turning a social demographic lens on the historical patterning of concordance among twin pairs, we identify a central mechanism for this association: de novo mutations, which are deletions, insertions, and duplications of DNA in the germ cells that are not present in the parents' DNA. Along the way, we show that a demographic eye on the rising prevalence of autism leads to three major discoveries. First, the estimated heritability of autism has been dramatically overstated. Second, heritability estimates can change over remarkably short periods of time because of increases in germ cell mutations. Third, social demographic change can yield genetic changes that, at the population level, combine to contribute to the increased prevalence of autism. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Child  a Children  a Cohorts  a Demographics  a Population  aJournal Article  g47g2h327-43tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1110722&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201002553naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450068001751000025002437000020002681100039002887100039003275201291003666500068016576500053017256500055017786510009018336530016018426530031018586530019018896530018019086550020019267730030019468560006019768560196019829030013021781110723  a201007       201005                        eng     aEP51701429  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ21  aJ22  aJ6310aEmployment and Self-Employment in the Wake of Hurricane Katrina10aZissimopoulos, Julie10aKaroly, Lynn A.  aRAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aRAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aWe use data from the monthly Current Population Survey to examine the short- and longer-term effects of Hurricane Katrina on the labor market outcomes of prime-age individuals in the most affected states--Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi--and for evacuees in any state. We focus on rates of labor force participation, employment, and unemployment, and we extend prior research by also examining rates of self-employment. With the exception of Mississippi, employment and unemployment one year after the hurricane were at similar rates as the end of 2003. This aggregate pattern of labor market shock and recovery has been observed for other disasters but masks important differences among subgroups. Those evacuated from their residences, even temporarily, were a harder-hit group, and evacuees who had yet to return to their pre-Katrina state up to one year later were hit especially hard; these findings hold even after controlling for differences in observable characteristics. We also find evidence of an important role for self-employment as part of post-disaster labor market recovery, especially for evacuees who did not return. This may result from poor job prospects in the wage and salary sector or new opportunities for starting businesses in the wake of Katrina. 4aLabor Force and Employment, Size, and Structure         b(J21) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aLabor Turnover; Vacancies; Layoffs         b(J63)  aU.S.  aLabor Force  a Labor Force Participation  a Participation  a Unemployment  aJournal Article  g47g2h345-67tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1110723&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201002603naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450116001751000016002917000018003071100009003257100018003345201303003526500066016556500065017216500081017866510009018676530014018766530017018906530032019076530014019396530011019536550020019647730030019848560006020148560196020209030013022161110724  a201007       201005                        eng     aEP51701430  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aJ61  aJ6210aIntergenerational Mobility in the Post-1965 Immigration Era: Estimates by an Immigrant Generation Cohort Method10aPark, Julie10aMyers, Dowell  aU MD  aU Southern CA  aThe new second generation of the post-1965 immigration era is observed as children with their parents in 1980 and again as adults 25 years later. Intergenerational mobility is assessed for both men and women in four major racial/ethnic groups, both in regard to children's status attainment relative to parents and with regard to the rising societal standards proxied by native-born non-Hispanic whites. A profile of intergenerational mobility is prepared using multiple indicators of status attainment: high school and college completion, upper white-collar occupation, poverty, and homeownership. The immigrant generation cohort method we introduce accounts for four distinct temporal dimensions of immigrant progress, clarifying inconsistencies in the literature and highlighting differences in mobility between racial/ethnic groups and with respect to different outcome measures. The immigrant generation cohort method consistently finds greater intergenerational mobility than suggested by alternative approaches. Our analysis also shows that the intergenerational progress of women is greater than that of men and provides a more complete record of immigrant mobility overall. Findings for individual racial/ethnic groups accord with some expectations in the literature and contradict others. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aJob, Occupational, and Intergenerational Mobility; Promotion         b(J62)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  a Immigration  a Intergenerational Mobility  a Mobility  a Women  aJournal Article  g47g2h369-92tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1110724&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201002937naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450107001751000022002827000019003047000020003237000024003431100055003677100009004227100035004317100009004665201497004756500077019726500076020496500049021256510009021746530010021836530014021936530015022076530016022226530011022386550020022497730031022698560006023008560196023069030013025021110725  a201007       201005                        eng     aEP51701431  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ13  aJ1910aBiodemographic Modeling of the Links between Fertility Motivation and Fertility Outcomes in the NLSY7910aMiller, Warren B.10aBard, David E.10aPasta, David J.10aRodgers, Joseph Lee  aTransnational Family Research Institute, Aptos, CA  aU OK  aDMA Corporation, Palo Alto, CA  aU OK  aIn spite of long-held beliefs that traits related to reproductive success tend to become fixed by evolution with little or no genetic variation, there is now considerable evidence that the natural variation of fertility within populations is genetically influenced and that a portion of that influence is related to the motivational precursors to fertility. We conduct a two-stage analysis to examine these inferences in a time-ordered multivariate context. First, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979, and LISREL analysis, we develop a structural equation model in which five hypothesized motivational precursors to fertility, measured in 1979-1982, predict both a child-timing and a child-number outcome, measured in 2002. Second, having chosen two time-ordered sequences of six variables from the SEM to represent our phenotypic models, we use Mx to conduct both univariate and multivariate behavioral genetic analyses with the selected variables. Our results indicate that one or more genes acting within a gene network have additive effects that operate through child-number desires to affect both the timing of the next child born and the final number of children born, that one or more genes acting through a separate network may have additive effects operating through gender role attitudes to produce downstream effects on the two fertility outcomes, and that no genetic variance is associated with either child-timing intentions or educational intentions. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aDemographic Economics: Other         b(J19)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Fertility  a Population  a Youth  aJournal Article  g47g2h393-414tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1110725&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201002717naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450060001671000024002277000026002511100009002777100009002865201363002956500084016586500076017426510009018186530015018276530011018426530011018536530018018646530015018826530014018976530013019116530014019246530012019386530014019506530012019646530019019766530011019956550020020067730030020268560006020568560196020629030013022581110726  a201007       201005                        eng     aEP51701432  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aFamily Structure and the Transition to Early Parenthood10aHofferth, Sandra L.10aGoldscheider, Frances  aU MD  aU MD  aWith the rise in out-of-wedlock childbearing and divorce in the last quarter of the twentieth century, an increasing proportion of children have been exposed to a variety of new family forms. Little research has focused on the consequences of childhood family structure for men's transition to fatherhood or on the family processes that account for the effects of family structure on the likelihood that young women and men become first-time unmarried parents, what we now call "fragile families." The data come from the linked Children and Young Adult samples of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79), which provide information on the children of the women of the NLSY79 from birth until they enter young adulthood. Females growing up with a single parent and males experiencing an unstable family transition to parenthood early, particularly to nonresidential fatherhood for males. For males, the effects are strongly mediated by parenting processes and adolescent behaviors and are shaped by economic circumstances. Having experienced multiple transitions as a child is associated with a reduced likelihood that males father their first child within marriage and an increased likelihood that they become fathers within cohabitation, demonstrating how changes in family structure alter family structure patterns over time and generations. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAdolescent  a Birth  a Child  a Childbearing  a Childhood  a Children  a Divorce  a Families  a Family  a Marriage  a Parent  a Single Parent  a Youth  aJournal Article  g47g2h415-37tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1110726&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201002664naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450151001831000019003341100020003535201181003736500076015546500066016306500083016966500065017796510011018446530017018556530014018726530015018866530012019016530015019136530012019286530016019406530010019566530011019666550020019777730030019978560006020278560196020339030013022291110727  a201007       201005                        eng     aEP51701433  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ16  aJ24  aJ3110aChoice of Study Discipline and the Postponement of Motherhood in Europe: The Impact of Expected Earnings, Gender Composition, and Family Attitudes10aVan Bavel, Jan  aFree U Brussels  aTheory suggests that the field of study may be at least as consequential for fertility behavior as the duration and level of education. Yet, this qualitative dimension of educational achievement has been largely neglected in demographic studies. This article analyzes the mechanisms relating the field of study with the postponement of motherhood by European college-graduate women aged 20-40. The second round of the European Social Survey is used to assess the impact of four features of study disciplines that are identified as key to reproductive decision making: the expected starting wage, the steepness of the earning profile, attitudes toward gendered family roles, and gender composition. The results indicate that the postponement of motherhood is relatively limited among graduates from study disciplines in which stereotypical attitudes about family roles prevail and in which a large share of the graduates are female. Both the level of the starting wage and the steepness of the earning profile are found to be associated with greater postponement. These results are robust to controlling for the partnership situation and the age at entry into the labor market. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31)  aEurope  aDemographics  a Earnings  a Education  a Female  a Fertility  a Gender  a Motherhood  a Wage  a Women  aJournal Article  g47g2h439-58tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1110727&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201002473naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450121001831000022003047000024003261100014003507100014003645201032003786500077014106500084014876500113015716500098016846510009017826530013017916530014018046530016018186550020018347730030018548560006018848560196018909030013020861110728  a201007       201005                        eng     aEP51701434  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ12  aJ15  aZ1311aA Comparative Perspective on Intermarriage: Explaining Differences among National-Origin Groups in the United States10aKalmijn, Matthijs10avan Tubergen, Frank  aTilburg U  aUtrecht U  aLittle is known about the validity of group-level theories of ethnic intermarriage despite the fact that such theories are often invoked in explaining why certain ethnic groups are "closed," whereas others are relatively "open." We develop a comparative perspective by analyzing the marriage choices of 94 national-origin groups in the United States, using pooled data from the Current Population Surveys, 1994-2006, and multilevel models in which individual and contextual determinants of intermarriage are included simultaneously. Our analyses show large differences in endogamy across groups. After taking compositional effects into account, we find that both structural and cultural group-level factors have significant effects on endogamy. Cultural explanations (which focus on the role of norms and preferences) play a more important role than structural explanations (which focus on meeting and mating opportunities). Our results reinforce the common but untested interpretation of endogamy in terms of group boundaries. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aU.S.  aCultural  a Marriage  a Population  aJournal Article  g47g2h459-79tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1110728&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201002502naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450117001831000022003001100008003225201165003306500042014956500084015376500065016216500109016866510026017956530013018216530013018346530015018476530012018626550020018747730031018948560006019258560196019319030013021271110729  a201007       201005                        eng     aEP51701435  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ12  aJ31  aO1510aEducational Assortative Mating and Economic Inequality: A Comparative Analysis of Three Latin American Countries10aTorche, Florencia  aNYU  aEducational assortative mating and economic inequality are likely to be endogenously determined, but very little research exists on their empirical association. Using census data and log-linear and log-multiplicative methods, I compare the patterns of educational assortative mating in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, and explore the association between marital sorting and earnings inequality across countries. The analysis finds substantial variation in the strength of specific barriers to educational intermarriage between countries, and a close association between these barriers and the earnings gaps across educational categories within countries. This finding suggests an isomorphism between assortative mating and economic inequality. Furthermore, educational marital sorting is remarkably symmetric across gender in spite of the different resources that men and women bring to the union. This study highlights the limitations of using single aggregate measures of spousal educational resemblance (such as the correlation coefficient between spouses' schooling) to capture variation in assortative mating and its relationship with socioeconomic inequality. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBrazil; Chile; Mexico  aEarnings  a Marital  a Schooling  a Spouse  aJournal Article  g47g2h481-502tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1110729&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201002182naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450075001831000020002581100026002785200699003046500074010036500117010776500076011946500057012706510032013276530010013596530015013696530014013846530017013986530023014156530015014386530015014536530012014686530015014806550020014957730030015158560006015458560196015519030013017471110730  a201007       201005                        eng     aEP51701436  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aH53  aI38  aJ13  aJ1813aThe Impact of Family Policy Expenditure on Fertility in Western Europe10aKalwij, Adriaan  aUtrecht U and NETSPAR  aThis article analyzes the impact on fertility of changes in national expenditure for family allowances, maternity- and parental-leave benefits, and childcare subsidies. To do so, I estimate a model for the timing of births using individual-level data from 16 western European countries, supplemented with data on national social expenditure for different family policy programs. The latter allow approximation of the subsidies that households with children receive from such programs. The results show that increased expenditure on family policy programs that help women to combine family and employment--and thus reduce the opportunity cost of children--generates positive fertility responses. 4aNational Government Expenditures and Welfare Programs         b(H53) 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aDemographic Economics: Public Policy         b(J18)  aSelected European Countries  aBirth  a Childcare  a Children  a Expenditure  a Family Allowances  a Fertility  a Maternity  a Policy  a Subsidies  aJournal Article  g47g2h503-19tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1110730&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201002029naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450073001751000020002487000020002681100009002887100015002975200828003126500076011406500066012166500109012826510010013916530010014016530015014116550020014267730030014468560006014768560196014829030013016781110731  a201007       201005                        eng     aEP51701437  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ16  aO1510aSon Targeting Fertility Behavior: Some Consequences and Determinants10aBasu, Deepankar10ade Jong, Robert  aU MA  aOH State U  aThis article draws out some implications of son targeting fertility behavior and studies its determinants. We demonstrate that such behavior has two notable implications at the aggregate level: (a) girls have a larger number of siblings (sibling effect), and (b) girls are born at relatively earlier parities within families (birth-order effect). Empirically testing for these effects, we find that both are present in many countries in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and North Africa but are absent in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Using maximum likelihood estimation, we study the effect of covariates on son targeting fertility behavior in India, a country that displays significant sibling and birth-order effects. We find that income and geographic location of families significantly affect son targeting behavior. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aIndia  aBirth  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g47g2h521-36tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1110731&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 201002236naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450038001751000028002131100037002415201125002786500038014036500073014416500076015146510009015906530015015996530016016146530012016306550020016427730028016628560006016908560196016969030018018921095386  a201004       201002                        eng     aEP47670256  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aI18  aJ1311aAn Integrative Approach to Health10aHarris, Kathleen Mullan  aCarolina Population Center, U NC  aIn this article, I make the case for using an integrative approach to health, broadly defined as social, emotional, mental, and physical well-being; for studying health among the young as an important marker for future health and well-being across the life course; and for understanding health disparities among the young as both causes and consequences of social stratification. An integrative approach bridges biomedical sciences with social and behavioral sciences by understanding the linkages between social, behavioral, psychological, and biological factors in health. It is furthermore vital that integration occur in all steps of the research process: in theory, design, data collection, and analysis. I use the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, or Add Health, as an example of an integrative approach to health and of the importance of adolescence and the transition to adulthood years for setting health trajectories into adulthood. Evidence is also presented on the linkages between health trajectories during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and social stratification in adulthood. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAdolescent  a Biomedical  a Health  aJournal Article  g47g1h1-22tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1095386&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201000467naa  2200133   4500001001100000008004400011022001300055245002600068655001200094773001000106856000600116856019900122903001200321EP47670255       201002                        eng     a0070337010aNOTE FROM THE EDITOR.  aArticle  g47g1  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=EP47670255&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFeb201002972naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450118001751000018002937000021003111100009003327100044003415201465003856500038018506500108018886500109019966510016021056530013021216530013021346530012021476530019021596530024021786530015022026530013022176530010022306530016022406530013022566550020022697730029022898560006023188560196023249030018025201095387  a201004       201002                        eng     aEP47670257  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ14  aO1510aEarly Life Exposures and the Occurrence and Timing of Heart Disease among the Older Adult Puerto Rican Population10aMcEniry, Mary10aPalloni, Alberto  aU WI  aCenter for Demography and Ecology, U WI  aFew studies have examined the effects of early life conditions on the timing of the onset of heart disease. We use the remarkable example of a representative sample of the population of older Puerto Ricans aged 60-74 who lived in the countryside during childhood (n = 1,438) to examine the effects of seasonal exposures to poor nutrition and infectious diseases during late gestation on the timing of the onset and the probability of ever experiencing adult heart disease. Cox and log logistic hazard models controlling for childhood conditions (self-reported childhood health status and socioeconomic status [SES], rheumatic fever, and knee height) and adult risk factors (adult SES, obesity, smoking, exercise, and self-reported diabetes) showed that the risk of onset of heart disease was 65% higher among those born during high-exposure periods compared with unexposed individuals. However, there were no significant differences in median time of onset for those ever experiencing heart disease. As a comparison, we found that there were no significant seasonality effects for those who lived in urban areas during childhood. We conclude that early exposures in utero have important ramifications for adult heart disease among the older Puerto Rican population. We show, however, that while exposure is associated with the probability of ever experiencing adult heart disease, it is not associated with the timing of onset among those who do experience it. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aPuerto Rico  aDiabetes  a Disease  a Health  a Heart Disease  a Infectious Disease  a Nutrition  a Obesity  a Poor  a Population  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g47g1h23-43tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1095387&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201002106naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450081001751000019002567000021002751100009002967100009003055200665003146500038009796500166010176500124011836510009013076530012013166530012013286530019013406530015013596530021013746530012013956530011014076530009014186550020014277730029014478560006014768560196014829030018016781095388  a201004       201002                        eng     aEP47670258  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aN31  aN4110aHealth, Wartime Stress, and Unit Cohesion: Evidence from Union Army Veterans10aCosta, Dora L.10aKahn, Matthew E.  aUCLA  aUCLA  aWe find that Union Army veterans of the American Civil War who faced greater wartime stress (as measured by higher battlefield mortality rates) experienced higher mortality rates at older ages, but that men who were from more cohesive companies were statistically significantly less likely to be affected by wartime stress.

These fan charts are based on a mortality model calibrated on mortality data for English and Welsh males. The fan charts indicate strong upward sloping trends in future life expectancy. Their widths indicate the extent of uncertainty in these projections, and this uncertainty increases as the forecast horizon lengthens. Allowing for uncertainty in the parameter values of the model adds further to uncertainty in life expectancy projections. The article also illustrates how longevity fan charts can be used to stress-test longevity outcomes. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.K.  aMortality  aJournal Article  g47g1h67-78tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1095389&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201002930naa  2200457   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450083001751000023002587000019002817000021003007000019003211100021003407100027003617100044003887100044004325201354004766500038018306500108018686500109019766510017020856530010021026530013021126530015021256530013021406530012021536530015021656530013021806530010021936550020022037730029022238560006022528560196022589030018024541095390  a201004       201002                        eng     aEP47670260  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ14  aO1510aObesity and Excess Mortality among the Elderly in the United States and Mexico10aMonteverde, Malena10aNoronha, Kenya10aPalloni, Alberto10aNovak, Beatriz  aCONICET, Cordoba  aFederal U Minas Gerais  aCenter for Demography and Ecology, U WI  aCenter for Demography and Ecology, U WI  aIncreasing levels of obesity could compromise future gains in life expectancy in low- and high-income countries. Although excess mortality associated with obesity and, more generally, higher levels of body mass index (BMI) have been investigated in the United States, there is little research about the impact of obesity on mortality in Latin American countries, where very the rapid rate of growth of prevalence of obesity and overweight occur jointly with poor socioeconomic conditions. The aim of this article is to assess the magnitude of excess mortality due to obesity and overweight in Mexico and the United States. For this purpose, we take advantage of two comparable data sets: the Health and Retirement Study 2000 and 2004 for the United States, and the Mexican Health and Aging Study 2001 and 2003 for Mexico. We find higher excess mortality risks among obese and overweight individuals aged 60 and older in Mexico than in the United States. Yet, when analyzing excess mortality among different socioeconomic strata, we observe greater gaps by education in the United States than in Mexico. We also find that although the probability of experiencing obesity-related chronic diseases among individuals with high BMI is larger for the U.S. elderly, the relative risk of dying conditional on experiencing these diseases is higher in Mexico. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMexico; U.S.  aAging  a Disease  a Education  a Elderly  a Health  a Mortality  a Obesity  a Poor  aJournal Article  g47g1h79-96tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1095390&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201002516naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450110001751000023002857000019003087000022003277000023003491100035003727100012004077100012004197100035004315201060004666500054015266500076015806500109016566510016017656530010017816530018017916530015018096530012018246550020018367730030018568560006018868560196018929030018020881095391  a201004       201002                        eng     aEP47670261  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aC51  aJ13  aO1510aMultivariate Analysis of Parity Progression-Based Measures of the Total Fertility Rate and Its Components10aRetherford, Robert10aOgawa, Naohiro10aMatsukura, Rikiya20aEini-Zinab, Hassan  aEast-West Center, Honolulu, HI  aNihon U  aNihon U  aEast-West Center, Honolulu, HI  aThis article describes a methodology for applying a discrete-time survival model--the complementary log-log model--to estimate effects of socioeconomic variables on (1) the total fertility rate and its components and (2) trends in the total fertility rate and its components. For the methodology to be applicable, the total fertility rate (TFR) must be calculated from parity progression ratios (PPRs). The components of the TFR are PPRs, the total marital fertility rate (TMFR), and the TFR itself as measures of the quantum of fertility, and mean and median ages at first marriage and mean and median closed birth intervals by birth order as measures of the tempo or timing of fertility. The focus is on effects of predictor variables on these measures rather than on coefficients, which are often difficult to interpret in the complex models that are considered. The methodology is applicable to both period and cohort data. It is illustrated by application to data from the 1993, 1998, and 2003 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in the Philippines. 4aModel Construction and Estimation         b(C51) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aPhilippines  aBirth  a Demographics  a Fertility  a Health  aJournal Article  g47g1h97-124tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1095391&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201003095naa  2200517   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450108001831000022002917000022003137000023003357000024003587000020003821100037004027100012004397100012004517100012004637100012004755201393004876500038018806500076019186500066019946500109020606510014021696530010021836530015021936530014022086530015022226530015022376530015022526530014022676530015022816530011022966550020023077730030023278560006023578560196023639030018025591095392  a201004       201002                        eng     aEP47670262  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aJ16  aO1510aChildhood Nutrition and Later Fertility: Pathways through Education and Pre-pregnant Nutritional Status10aGraff, Mariaelisa10aYount, Kathryn M.10aRamakrishnan, Usha10aMartorell, Reynaldo10aStein, Aryeh D.  aCarolina Population Center, U NC  aEmory U  aEmory U  aEmory U  aEmory U  aBetter childhood nutrition is associated with earlier physical maturation during adolescence and increased schooling attainment. However, as earlier onset of puberty and increased schooling can have opposing effects on fertility, the net effect of improvements in childhood nutrition on a woman's fertility are uncertain. Using path analysis, we estimate the strength of the pathways between childhood growth and subsequent fertility outcomes in Guatemalan women studied prospectively since birth. Height for age z score at 24 months was positively related to body mass index (BMI kg/m[superscript 2]) and height (cm) in adolescence and to schooling attainment. BMI was negatively associated (-0.23 +/- 0.09 years per kg/m[superscript 2]; p < .05) and schooling was positively associated (0.38 +/- 0.06 years per grade; p < .001) with age at first birth. Total associations with the number of children born were positive from BMI (0.07 +/- 0.02 per kg/m2; p < .05) and negative from schooling (-0.18 +/- 0.02 per grade; p < .01). Height was not related to age at first birth or the number of children born. Taken together, childhood nutrition, as reflected by height at 2 years, was positively associated with delayed age at first birth and fewer children born. If schooling is available for girls, increased growth during childhood will most likely result in a net decrease in fertility. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aGuatemala  aBirth  a Childhood  a Children  a Education  a Fertility  a Nutrition  a Pregnant  a Schooling  a Women  aJournal Article  g47g1h125-44tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1095392&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201001958naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450071001671000020002387000024002587000023002821100039003057100039003447100039003835200731004226500038011536500076011916510009012676530010012766530011012866530015012976530014013126550020013267730030013468560006013768560196013829030018015781095393  a201004       201002                        eng     aEP47670263  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1310aEndowments and Parental Investments in Infancy and Early Childhood10aDatar, Ashlesha10aKilburn, M.

We estimate how the difference in birth weight across siblings impacts specific parental investments: breast-feeding, well-baby visits, immunizations, and preschool attendance. Our results indicate that normal-birth-weight children are 5%-11% more likely to receive early childhood parental investments than their low-birth-weight siblings. Moreover, the presence of additional low-birth-weight siblings in the household increases the likelihood of investments such as well-baby visits and immunizations for normal-birth-weight children. These results suggest that parental investments in early childhood tend to reinforce endowment differences. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Child  a Childhood  a Children  aJournal Article  g47g1h145-62tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1095393&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201002309naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450083001751000021002587000023002797000019003021100015003217100052003367100013003885200880004016500042012816500076013236500109013996510013015086530010015216530014015316530015015456530012015606530019015726530013015916530013016046550020016177730030016378560006016678560196016739030018018691095394  a201004       201002                        eng     aEP47670264  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ13  aO1510aOrphanhood and Human Capital Destruction: Is There Persistence into Adulthood?10aBeegle, Kathleen10aDe Weerdt, Joachim10aDercon, Stefan  aWorld Bank  aEconomic Development Initiatives, Dar es Salaam  aU Oxford  aThis article presents unique evidence that orphanhood matters in the long run for health and education outcomes in a region of northwestern Tanzania. We study a sample of 718 non-orphaned children surveyed in 1991-1994 who were traced and reinterviewed as adults in 2004. A large proportion, 19%, lost one or more parents before age 15 in this period, allowing us to assess permanent health and education impacts of orphanhood. In the analysis, we control for a wide range of child and adult characteristics before orphanhood, as well as community fixed effects. We find that maternal orphanhood has a permanent adverse impact of 2 cm of final height attainment and one year of educational attainment. Expressing welfare in terms of consumption expenditure, the result is a gap of 8.5% compared with similar children whose mothers survived until at least their 15th birthday. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aTanzania  aChild  a Children  a Education  a Health  a Human Capital  a Mothers  a Welfare  aJournal Article  g47g1h163-80tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1095394&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201002610naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450120001751000016002957000018003117000018003291100014003477100015003617100014003765201203003906500084015936500076016776500066017536510009018196530010018286530011018386530014018496530014018636530015018776530013018926530012019056550020019177730031019378560006019688560196019749030018021701095395  a201004       201002                        eng     aEP87688634  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ13  aJ1610aParenting as a 'Package Deal': Relationships, Fertility, and Nonresident Father Involvement among Unmarried Parents10aTach, Laura10aMincy, Ronald10aEdin, Kathryn  aHarvard U  aColumbia U  aHarvard U  aFatherhood has traditionally been viewed as part of a "package deal" in which a father's relationship with his child is contingent on his relationship with the mother. We evaluate the accuracy of this hypothesis in light of the high rates of multiple-partner fertility among unmarried parents using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a recent longitudinal survey of nonmarital births in large cities. We examine whether unmarried mothers' and fathers' subsequent relationship and parenting transitions are associated with declines in fathers' contact with their nonresident biological children. We find that father involvement drops sharply after relationships between unmarried parents end. Mothers' transitions into new romantic partnerships and new parenting roles are associated with larger declines in involvement than fathers' transitions. Declines in fathers' involvement following a mother's relationship or parenting transition are largest when children are young. We discuss the implications of our results for the well-being of nonmarital children and the quality of nonmarital relationships faced with high levels of relationship instability and multiple-partner fertility. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Child  a Children  a Families  a Fertility  a Mothers  a Parent  aJournal Article  g47g1h181-204tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1095395&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201002428naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450043001671000022002107000019002327000018002511100009002697100015002787100015002935201191003086500084014996500076015836510009016596530010016686530011016786530019016896530014017086530014017226530013017366530011017496550020017607730030017808560006018108560196018169030018020121095396  a201004       201002                        eng     aEP47670265  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aPatterns of Nonresident Father Contact10aCheadle, Jacob E.10aAmato, Paul R.10aKing, Valarie  aU NE  aPA State U  aPA State U  aWe used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort (NLSY79) from 1979 to 2002 and the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (CNLSY) from 1986 to 2002 to describe the number, shape, and population frequencies of U.S. nonresident father contact trajectories over a 14-year period using growth mixture models. The resulting four-category classification indicated that nonresident father involvement is not adequately characterized by a single population with a monotonic pattern of declining contact over time. Contrary to expectations, about two-thirds of fathers were consistently either highly involved or rarely involved in their children's lives. Only one group, constituting approximately 23% of fathers, exhibited a clear pattern of declining contact. In addition, a small group of fathers (8%) displayed a pattern of increasing contact. A variety of variables differentiated between these groups, including the child's age at father-child separation, whether the child was born within marriage, the mother's education, the mother's age at birth, whether the father pays child support regularly, and the geographical distance between fathers and children. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Child  a Child Support  a Children  a Marriage  a Mothers  a Youth  aJournal Article  g47g1h205-25tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1095396&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201002601naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450077001831000022002607000020002821100009003027100021003115201125003326500116014576500050015736500113016236500078017366510009018146530019018236530011018426530012018536530015018656530018018806530023018986550020019217730030019418560006019718560196019779030018021731095397  a201004       201002                        eng     aEP47670266  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aE24  aE32  aJ15  aJ6410aLast Hired, First Fired? Black-White Unemployment and the Business Cycle10aCouch, Kenneth A.10aFairlie, Robert  aU CT  aU CA, Santa Cruz  aStudies have tested the claim that blacks are the last hired during periods of economic growth and the first fired in recessions by examining the movement of relative unemployment rates over the business cycle. Any conclusion drawn from this type of analysis must be viewed as tentative because cyclical movements in the underlying transitions into and out of unemployment are not examined. Using Current Population Survey data matched across adjacent months from 1989-2004, this article provides the first detailed examination of labor market transitions for prime-age black and white men to test the last hired, first fired hypothesis. Considerable evidence is presented that blacks are the first fired as the business cycle weakens. However, no evidence is found that blacks are the last hired. Instead, blacks appear to be initially hired from the ranks of the unemployed early in the business cycle and later are drawn from nonparticipation. The narrowing of the racial unemployment gap near the peak of the business cycle is driven by a reduction in the rate of job loss for blacks rather than increases in hiring. 4aEmployment; Unemployment; Wages; Intergenerational Income Distribution; Aggregate Human Capital         b(E24) 4aBusiness Fluctuations; Cycles         b(E32) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUnemployment: Models, Duration, Incidence, and Job Search         b(J64)  aU.S.  aBusiness Cycle  a Cycle  a Racial  a Recession  a Unemployment  a Unemployment Rate  aJournal Article  g47g1h227-47tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1095397&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201002231naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450077001751000025002527000021002771100021002987100021003195200984003406500042013246500066013666500109014326510010015416530009015516530015015606530012015756530012015876550020015997730030016198560006016498560196016559030018018511095398  a201004       201002                        eng     aEP47670267  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ16  aO1510aEducation and Gender Bias in the Sex Ratio at Birth: Evidence from India10aEchavarri, Rebeca A.10aEzcurra, Roberto  aPublic U Navarra  aPublic U Navarra  aThis article investigates the possible existence of a nonlinear link between female disadvantage in natality and education. To this end, we devise a theoretical model based on the key role of social interaction in explaining people's acquisition of preferences, which justifies the existence of a nonmonotonic relationship between female disadvantage in natality and education. The empirical validity of the proposed model is examined for the case of India, using district-level data. In this context, our econometric analysis pays particular attention to the role of spatial dependence to avoid any potential problems of misspecification. The results confirm that the relationship between the sex ratio at birth and education in India follows an inverted U-shape. This finding is robust to the inclusion of additional explanatory variables in the analysis, and to the choice of the spatial weight matrix used to quantify the spatial interdependence between the sample districts. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aIndia  aBias  a Education  a Female  a Gender  aJournal Article  g47g1h249-68tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1095398&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 201000816naa  2200217   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450064001591000020002231100046002436500042002896550020003317730025003518560006003768560196003829030020005781143618  a201012       201001                        eng     aEP55249603  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aY2010aPrologue: Research on the Demography and Economics of Aging10aSuzman, Richard  aNational Institute on Aging, Bethesda, MD 4aIntroductory Material         b(Y20)  aJournal Article  g47hS1-4tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1143618&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aSupplement 201001117naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450054001671000023002217000024002441100040002687100040003086500077003486500108004256530010005336530016005436550020005597730026005798560006006058560196006119030020008071143619  a201012       201001                        eng     aEP55249604  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ1410aKey Themes in Research on the Demography of Aging10aSchoeni, Robert F.10aOfstedal, Mary Beth  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aAging  a Demography  aJournal Article  g47hS5-15tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1143619&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aSupplement 201002438naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450081001671000021002487000023002697000026002921100041003187100040003597100040003995201135004396500038015746500108016126510009017206530015017296530013017446530012017576530013017696530013017826550020017957730027018158560006018428560196018489030020020441143620  a201012       201001                        eng     aEP55249605  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1410aTrends in Health of Older Adults in the United States: Past, Present, Future10aMartin, Linda G.10aSchoeni, Robert F.10aAndreski, Patricia M.  aRAND Corporation and Johns Hopkins U  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aThe decline in late-life disability prevalence in the United States was one of the most important developments in the well-being of older Americans in the 1980s and 1990s, but there is no guarantee that it will continue into the future. We review the past literature on trends in disability and other health indicators and then estimate the most recent trends in biomarkers and limitations for both the population aged 65 and older and those aged 40 to 64, the future elderly. We then investigate the extent to which trends in education, smoking, and obesity can account for recent trends in limitations and discuss how these three factors might influence future prospects for late-life health. We find that improvements in the health of the older population generally have continued into the first decade of the twenty-first century. The recent increase in the proportion of the younger population needing help with activities of daily living is concerning, as is the doubling of obesity in the last few decades. However, the increase in obesity has recently paused, and favorable trends in education and smoking are encouraging. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aDisability  a Elderly  a Health  a Obesity  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g47hS17-40tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1143620&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aSupplement 201002430naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450109001671000021002767000017002977000030003141100045003447100045003897100045004345201084004796500038015636500077016016510009016786530017016876530013017046530012017176530015017296530015017446530016017596550020017757730027017958560006018228560196018289030020020241143621  a201012       201001                        eng     aEP55249606  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1110aBiodemography: New Approaches to Understanding Trends and Differences in Population Health and Mortality10aCrimmins, Eileen10aKim, Jung Ki10aVasunilashorn, Sarinnapha  aAndrus Gerontology Center, U Southern CA  aAndrus Gerontology Center, U Southern CA  aAndrus Gerontology Center, U Southern CA  aThe incorporation of biological information in large population surveys has expanded demographic analysis to clarify the meaning of observed trends and differences in population health and mortality. Levels of measured biological risk in the population were reduced in recent years largely because of the expanded use of prescription drugs. The increased use of antihypertensives and, to a lesser extent, lipid-lowering drugs was a likely cause of significant mortality reduction. Blacks and persons with lower educational attainment experience higher levels of biological risk factors, more diseases, and more frailty; these differences are the sources of higher mortality for these groups. Hispanics are less likely to have a higher prevalence of risk factors and diseases than the non-Hispanic population, providing further understanding of the "Hispanic paradox." Almost every examined indicator of biological risk, disease, and frailty is related to higher mortality, indicating how incorporation of this information provides a fuller understanding of the morbidity process. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Disease  a Health  a Morbidity  a Mortality  a Population  aJournal Article  g47hS41-64tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1143621&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aSupplement 201002530naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450049001671000015002167000022002311100049002537100049003025201450003516500038018016500077018396510009019166530010019256530012019356550020019477730027019678560006019948560196020009030020021961143622  a201012       201001                        eng     aEP55249607  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1110aCauses and Consequences of Early-Life Health10aCase, Anne10aPaxson, Christina  aCenter for Health and Wellbeing, Princeton U  aCenter for Health and Wellbeing, Princeton U  aWe examine the consequences of child health for economic and health outcomes in adulthood, using height as a marker of childhood health. After reviewing previous evidence, we present a conceptual framework that highlights data limitations and methodological problems that complicate the study of this topic. We then present estimates of the associations between height and a range of outcomes--including schooling, employment, earnings, health, and cognitive ability--measured in five data sets from early to late adulthood. These results indicate that, on average, taller individuals attain higher levels of education. Height is also positively associated with better economic, health, and cognitive outcomes. These associations are only partially explained by the higher average educational attainment of taller individuals. We then use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Children and Young Adults survey to document the associations between health, cognitive development, and growth in childhood. Even among children with the same mother, taller siblings score better on cognitive tests and progress through school more quickly. Part of the differences found between siblings arises from differences in their birth weights and lengths attributable to mother's behaviors while pregnant. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that childhood health influences health and economic status throughout adulthood. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Health  aJournal Article  g47hS65-85tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1143622&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aSupplement 201002784naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450056001751000017002317000019002481100049002677100049003165201482003656500048018476500084018956500108019796510009020876530010020966530014021066530016021206530016021366550020021527730028021728560006022008560196022069030020024021143623  a201012       201001                        eng     aEP55249608  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI31  aJ12  aJ1410aFamilies, Social Life, and Well-Being at Older Ages10aWaite, Linda10aDas, Aniruddha  aU Chicago and Center on Aging, NORC, Chicago  aU Chicago and Center on Aging, NORC, Chicago  aAs people age, many aspects of their lives tend to change, including the constellation of people with whom they are connected, their social context, their families, and their health--changes that are often interrelated. Wave I of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) has yielded rich information on intimate ties, especially dyads and families, and on social connections generally. Combined with extensive biological and other health measures, NSHAP enables researchers to address key questions on health and aging. We begin with recent findings on intimate dyads, then move to social participation, and finally to elder mistreatment. Among dyads, we find that whereas sexual activity drops sharply with age for both women and men, gender differences in partner loss as well as psychosocial and normative pressures constrain women's sex more than men's. However, surviving partnerships tend to be emotionally and physically satisfying and are marked by relatively frequent sex. In contrast to sex, nonsexual intimacy is highly prevalent at older ages, especially among women. Older adults are also socially resilient--adapting to the loss of social ties by increasing involvement with community and kin networks. Despite these social assets, older adults remain vulnerable to mistreatment. Overall, these findings yield a mixed picture of gender-differentiated vulnerabilities balanced by proactive adaptation and maintenance of social and dyadic assets. 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aAging  a Families  a Well Being  a Well-being  aJournal Article  g47hS87-109tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1143623&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aSupplement 201002276naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450078001671000022002457000016002671100052002837100040003355201070003756500107014456500108015526510009016606530010016696530013016796550020016927730028017128560006017408560196017469030020019421143624  a201012       201001                        eng     aEP55249609  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aC81  aJ1410aRecent Developments in Longitudinal Studies of Aging in the United States10aHauser, Robert M.10aWeir, David  aCenter for Demography of Health and Aging, U WI  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aWe review recent developments in longitudinal studies of aging, focusing on the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Both studies are part of a trend toward biosocial surveys in which biological measurement is joined with traditional survey techniques, and a related trend toward greater harmonization across studies. Both studies have collected DNA samples and are working toward genotyping that would allow broadly based association studies. Increased attention to psychological measurement of personality and of cognitive ability using adaptive testing structures has also been shared across the studies. The HRS has expanded its economic measurement to longitudinal studies of consumption and to broader-based measurement of pension and Social Security wealth. It has added biomarkers of cardiovascular risk. The WLS has developed an integrated approach to the study of death and bereavement and an innovative use of high school yearbook photographs to capture information about health in early life of its participants. 4aMethodology for Collecting, Estimating, and Organizing Microeconomic Data; Data Access         b(C81) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aAging  a Pension  aJournal Article  g47hS111-30tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1143624&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aSupplement 201002333naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450077001751000019002521100014002715201067002856500077013526500108014296500053015376510023015906530015016136530031016286530019016596530019016786530016016976550020017137730028017338560006017618560196017679030020019631143625  a201012       201001                        eng     aEP55249610  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ14  aJ2210aFacilitating Longer Working Lives: International Evidence on Why and How10aWise, David A.  aHarvard U  aThe article advances the view that social and economic choices in societies can reasonably adjust as the age structure of the population changes; in particular, some of the bounty of longer lives can reasonably be allocated to prolonging the labor force participation of older workers. Data on reductions in mortality and, in some countries, declines in disability are presented in ways that help to clarify that prolonged working lives may be a natural concomitant of living longer. The article reviews the problems inherent in the combination of living longer and reducing labor force participation at older ages. It discusses two ways to facilitate longer working lives: (1) eliminating penalties on work at older ages--inherent in the provisions of the social security programs in many countries--that induce older persons to leave the labor force at younger ages; and (2) correcting a false rationale--the "boxed economy" view of the labor market--that is often used to support retention of the provisions that induce older persons to leave the labor force. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22)  aSelected Countries  aDisability  a Labor Force Participation  a Older Workers  a Participation  a Population  aJournal Article  g47hS131-49tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1143625&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aSupplement 201002995naa  2200457   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450058001831000016002417000018002571100019002757100040002945201422003346500038017566500077017946500108018716500109019796510023020886530010021116530018021216530013021396530015021526530019021676530024021866530015022106530013022256530013022386530016022516550020022677730028022878560006023158560196023219030020025171143626  a201012       201001                        eng     aEP55249611  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ11  aJ14  aO1510aSome Macroeconomic Aspects of Global Population Aging10aLee, Ronald10aMason, Andrew  aU CA, Berkeley  aU HI and East-West Center, Honolulu  aAcross the demographic transition, declining mortality followed by declining fertility produces decades of rising support ratios as child dependency falls. These improving support ratios raise per capita consumption, other things equal, but eventually deteriorate as the population ages. Population aging and the forces leading to it can produce not only frightening declines in support ratios but also very substantial increases in productivity and per capita income by raising investment in physical and human capital. Longer life, lower fertility, and population aging all raise the demand for wealth needed to provide for old-age consumption. This leads to increased capital per worker even as aggregate saving rates fall. However, capital per worker may not rise if the increased demand for wealth is satisfied by increased familial or public pension transfers to the elderly. Thus, institutions and policies matter for the consequences of population aging. The accumulation of human capital also varies across the transition. Lower fertility and mortality are associated with higher human capital investment per child, also raising labor productivity. Together, the positive changes due to human and physical capital accumulation will likely outweigh the problems of declining support ratios. We draw on estimates and analyses from the National Transfer Accounts project to illustrate and quantify these points. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSelected Countries  aAging  a Demographics  a Elderly  a Fertility  a Human Capital  a Labor Productivity  a Mortality  a Old Age  a Pension  a Population  aJournal Article  g47hS151-72tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1143626&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aSupplement 201002516naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450096001671000026002637000021002897000020003101100015003307100057003457100051004025201218004536500064016716500073017356510009018086530016018176530012018336530017018456530022018626550020018847730028019048560006019328560196019389030020021341143627  a201012       201001                        eng     aEP55249612  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aH51  aI1813aThe Potential Impact of Comparative Effectiveness Research on U.S. Health Care Expenditures10aPerlroth, Daniella J.10aGoldman, Dana P.10aGarber, Alan M.  aStanford U  aU Southern CA and RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aStanford U and VA Palo Alto Health Care System  aComparative effectiveness research (CER) has the potential to slow health care spending growth by focusing resources on health interventions that provide the most value. In this article, we discuss issues surrounding CER and its implementation and apply these methods to a salient clinical example: treatment of prostate cancer. Physicians have several options for treating patients recently diagnosed with localized disease, including removal of the prostate (radical prostatectomy), treatment with radioactive seeds (brachytherapy), radiation therapy (IMRT), or--if none of these are pursued--active surveillance. Using a commercial health insurance claims database and after adjustment for comorbid conditions, we estimate that the additional cost of treatment with radical prostatectomy is $7,300, while other alternatives are more expensive--$19,000 for brachytherapy and $46,900 for IMRT. However, a review of the clinical literature uncovers no evidence that justifies the use of these more expensive approaches. These results imply that if patient management strategies were shifted to those supported by CER-based criteria, an estimated $1.7 to $3.0 billion (2009 present value) could be saved each year. 4aNational Government Expenditures and Health         b(H51) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18)  aU.S.  aExpenditure  a Health  a Health Care  a Health Insurance  aJournal Article  g47hS173-90tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1143627&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aSupplement 201001737naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450053001671000018002201100039002385200637002776500108009146500109010226510023011316530010011546530012011646550020011767730029011968560006012258560196012319030020014271143628  a201012       201001                        eng     aEP55249613  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ14  aO1510aWhat Can We Learn from (and about) Global Aging?10aKapteyn, Arie  aRAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aAlthough aging is a global phenomenon, there are large differences across countries in both the speed of aging and the current age composition.

I discuss under what circumstances data from different countries can be used for inference about policy effects. Although comparable health and retirement data are currently being collected in some 25 countries, the use of such data requires careful modeling of differences in institutions and in response styles across countries. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSelected Countries  aAging  a Health  aJournal Article  g47hS191-209tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1143628&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aSupplement 201002822naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450093001751000017002687000021002857000020003061100058003267100041003847100039004255201351004646500038018156500108018536500052019616510015020136530012020286530012020406530015020526530021020676530013020886530016021016530013021176550020021307730028021508560006021788560196021849030020023801143629  a201012       201001                        eng     aEP55249614  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ14  aJ2610aDisease Prevalence, Disease Incidence, and Mortality in the United States and in England10aBanks, James10aMuriel, Alastair10aSmith, James P.  aU Manchester and Institute for Fiscal Studies, London  aInstitute for Fiscal Studies, London  aRAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aWe find that both disease incidence and disease prevalence are higher among Americans in age groups 55-64 and 70-80, indicating that Americans suffer from higher past cumulative disease risk and experience higher immediate risk of new disease onset compared with the English. In contrast, age-specific mortality rates are similar in the two countries, with an even higher risk among the English after age 65. We also examine reasons for the large financial gradients in mortality in the two countries. Among 55- to 64-year-olds, we estimate similar health gradients in income and wealth in both countries, but for 70- to 80-year-olds, we find no income gradient in the United Kingdom. Standard behavioral risk factors (work, marriage, obesity, exercise, and smoking) almost fully explain income gradients among those aged 55-64 in both countries and a significant part among Americans 70-80 years old. The most likely explanation of the absence of an English income gradient relates to the English income benefit system: below the median, retirement benefits are largely flat and independent of past income, and hence past health, during the working years. Finally, we report evidence using a long panel of American respondents that their subsequent mortality is not related to large changes in wealth experienced during the prior 10-year period. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aRetirement; Retirement Policies         b(J26)  aU.K.; U.S.  aDisease  a Health  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  a Obesity  a Retirement  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g47hS211-31tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1143629&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aSupplement 201002575naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450039001751000020002147000018002347000030002521100015002827100016002977100014003135201268003276500038015956500077016336500076017106510025017866530014018116530014018256530013018396530012018526530015018646530016018796550020018957730030019158560006019458560196019519030018021471080171  a201001       200911                        eng     aEP44876808  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ11  aJ1311aAdult Height and Childhood Disease10aBozzoli, Carlos10aDeaton, Angus20aQuintana-Domeque, Climent  aDIW Berlin  aPrinceton U  aU Alacant  aTaller populations are typically richer populations, and taller individuals live longer and earn more. In consequence, adult height has recently become a focus in understanding the relationship between health and wealth. We investigate the childhood determinants of population adult height, focusing on the respective roles of income and of disease. Across a range of European countries and the United States, we find a strong inverse relationship between postneonatal (ages 1 month to 1 year) mortality, interpreted as a measure of the disease and nutritional burden in childhood, and the mean height of those children as adults. Consistent with these findings, we develop a model of selection and stunting in which the early-life burden of undernutrition and disease not only is responsible for mortality in childhood but also leaves a residue of long-term health risks for survivors, risks that express themselves in adult height and in late-life disease. The model predicts that at sufficiently high mortality levels, selection can dominate scarring, leaving a taller population of survivors. We find evidence of this effect in the poorest and highest-mortality countries of the world, supplementing recent findings on the effects of the Great Chinese Famine. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aEurope; Global; U.S.  aChildhood  a Children  a Disease  a Health  a Mortality  a Population  aJournal Article  g46g4h647-69tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1080171&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200903076naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450077001751000023002521100012002755201897002876500065021846500077022496500076023266510009024026530015024116530015024266530016024416530011024576550020024687730030024888560006025188560196025249030018027201080172  a201001       200911                        eng     aEP44876809  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI20  aJ11  aJ1310aUnderstanding Links between Adolescent Health and Educational Attainment10aJackson, Margot I.  aBrown U  aThe educational and economic consequences of poor health during childhood and adolescence have become increasingly clear, with a resurgence of evidence leading researchers to reconsider the potentially significant contribution of early-life health to population welfare both within and across generations. Meaningful relationships between early-life health and educational attainment raise important questions about how health may influence educational success in young adulthood and beyond, as well as for whom its influence is strongest. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, I examine how adolescents' health and social status act together to create educational disparities in young adulthood, focusing on two questions in particular. First, does the link between adolescent health and educational attainment vary across socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups? Second, what academic factors explain the connection between adolescent health and educational attainment? The findings suggest that poorer health in adolescence is strongly negatively related to educational attainment, net of both observed confounders and unobserved, time-invariant characteristics within households. The reduction in attainment is particularly large for non-Hispanic white adolescents, suggesting that the negative educational consequences of poor health are not limited to only the most socially disadvantaged adolescents. Finally, I find that the link between adolescent health and educational attainment is explained by academic factors related to educational participation and, most importantly, academic performance, rather than by reduced educational expectations. These findings add complexity to our understanding of how the educational consequences of poor health apply across the social hierarchy, as well as why poor health may lead adolescents to complete less schooling. 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAdolescent  a Childhood  a Population  a Youth  aJournal Article  g46g4h671-94tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1080172&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200902055naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450071001751000021002467000020002671100015002877100017003025200807003196500065011266500076011916500066012676510009013336530015013426530012013576530015013696530012013846530014013966550020014107730031014308560006014618560196014679030018016631080173  a201001       200911                        eng     aEP44876810  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI20  aJ13  aJ1613aThe Effect of Sexual Abstinence on Females' Educational Attainment10aSabia, Joseph J.10aRees, Daniel I.  aAmerican U  aU CO, Denver  aA number of studies have shown that teenagers who abstain from sex are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college than their sexually active peers. However, it is unclear whether this association represents a causal relationship or can be explained by unmeasured heterogeneity. We employ a variety of statistical techniques to distinguish between these hypotheses, using data on females from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Our results provide evidence that delaying first intercourse leads to an increased likelihood of graduating from high school. This relationship appears to be strongest among respondents in the bottom third of the ability distribution. Controlling for fertility reduces, but does not eliminate, the estimated effect of delaying intercourse. 4aEducation and Research Institutions: General         b(I20) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aAdolescent  a Female  a Fertility  a School  a Teenager  aJournal Article  g46g4h695-715tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1080173&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200902548naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450067001671000024002347000018002587000023002761100023002997100029003227100014003515201432003656500081017976500056018786510009019346530009019436550020019527730030019728560006020028560196020089030018022041080174  a201001       200911                        eng     aEP44876811  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD91  aI3213aThe Increasing Risk of Poverty across the American Life Course10aSandoval, Daniel A.10aRank, Mark R.10aHirschl, Thomas A.  aEastern CT State U  aWashington U in St Louis  aCornell U  aThis article extends the emerging body of life course research on poverty by empirically identifying the incidence, chronicity, and age pattern of American poverty and how these dimensions have changed during the period 1968-2000. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we construct a series of life tables that estimate the risk of poverty for adults during their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s, and compare these estimates for Americans in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Our empirical results suggest that the risk of acute poverty increased substantially, particularly in the 1990s. This observed increase was especially pronounced for individuals in their 20s, 30s, and 40s; for all age groups with respect to extreme poverty; and for white males. On the other hand, the risk of chronic poverty declined during the 1990s (as measured by the percentage of the poor who experienced five or more years of poverty within a 10-year interval). The results in this article tell a very different story than the Census Bureau's yearly cross-sectional rates, which have shown little overall change in the U.S. poverty rate during this 30-year period. In contrast, a life course approach reveals a rising economic risk of acute poverty for individuals, one that is consistent with recent observations and research suggesting that a growing number of Americans will eventually find themselves in an economically precarious position. 4aIntertemporal Household Choice; Life Cycle Models and Saving         b(D91) 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32)  aU.S.  aPoor  aJournal Article  g46g4h717-37tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1080174&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200902878naa  2200457   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001830430008001912450077001991000022002767000025002981100014003237100014003375200986003516500077013376500064014146500166014786500163016446500124018076500121019316510009020526530010020616530015020716530017020866530019021036530016021226530012021386550020021507730030021708560006022008560196022069030018024021080175  a201001       200911                        eng     aEP44876812  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aK42  aN31  aN32  aN41  aN4210aImmigration, Crime, and Incarceration in Early Twentieth-Century America10aMoehling, Carolyn10aPiehl, Anne Morrison  aRutgers U  aRutgers U  aThe major government commissions on immigration and crime in the early twentieth century relied on evidence that suffered from aggregation bias and the absence of accurate population data, which led them to present partial and sometimes misleading views of the immigrant-native criminality comparison. With improved data and methods, we find that in 1904, prison commitment rates for more serious crimes were quite similar by nativity for all ages except ages 18 and 19, for which the commitment rate for immigrants was higher than for the native-born. By 1930, immigrants were less likely than natives to be committed to prisons at all ages 20 and older, but this advantage disappears when one looks at commitments for violent offenses. The time series pattern reflects a growing gap between natives and immigrants at older ages, one that was driven by sharp increases in the commitment rates of the native-born, while commitment rates for the foreign-born were remarkably stable. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aIllegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law         b(K42) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32) 4aEconomic History: Government, War, Law, International Relations, and Regulation: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N41) 4aEconomic History: Government, War, Law, International Relations, and Regulation: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N42)  aU.S.  aCrime  a Immigrant  a Immigration  a Incarceration  a Population  a Prison  aJournal Article  g46g4h739-63tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1080175&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200902019naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450065001671000022002321100015002545200920002696500081011896500076012706510009013466530010013556530018013656530014013836530015013976530011014126550020014237730030014438560006014738560196014799030018016751080176  a201001       200911                        eng     aEP44876813  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD91  aJ1313aThe Evolution of Fertility Expectations over the Life Course10aHayford, Sarah R.  aAZ State U  aIn low-fertility contexts, how many children people have is largely a product of how many children they want. However, the social, institutional, and individual factors that influence how many children people want are not well understood. In particular, there is scant evidence about how fertility expectations change over the life course. This article provides an empirical description of changes in women's expected fertility over the entire span of childbearing years. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 cohort, group-based trajectory analysis illuminates common patterns in the evolution of fertility intentions and identifies individual characteristics associated with these patterns. Factors related to family formation, such as marriage and whether a woman has a child at an early age, are found to be the most consistent correlates of patterns of change in expected family size. 4aIntertemporal Household Choice; Life Cycle Models and Saving         b(D91) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Childbearing  a Children  a Fertility  a Youth  aJournal Article  g46g4h765-83tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1080176&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200902449naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450047001671000020002147000018002347000019002521100009002717100073002807100009003535201174003626500084015366500076016206510010016966530017017066530012017236530015017356530013017506530014017636530015017776550020017927730031018128560006018438560196018499030018020451080177  a201001       200911                        eng     aEP44876814  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aCohabitation and Family Formation in Japan10aRaymo, James M.10aIwasawa, Miho10aBumpass, Larry  aU WI  aNational Institute of Population and Social Security Research, Tokyo  aU WI  aThis article documents the prevalence, duration, and marital outcomes of cohabiting unions in Japan. It then examines the correlates of cohabitation experiences and also describes differences in the family-formation trajectories of women who have and have not cohabited. Cohabitation has increased rapidly among recent cohorts of women, and cohabiting unions in Japan tend to be relatively short in duration and are almost as likely to dissolve as to result in marriage. Life table analyses demonstrate that the cumulative probabilities of marriage and parenthood within marriage are roughly similar for women who did and those who did not cohabit. The most notable difference is in the pathways to family formation, with women who cohabited more likely both to marry subsequent to pregnancy and to delay childbearing within marriage. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that cohabiting unions in Japan are best viewed as an emerging prelude to marriage rather than as an alternative to marriage or singlehood. We conclude with speculation about the likelihood of further increases in cohabitation in Japan and the potential implications for marriage and fertility. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aJapan  aChildbearing  a Family  a Fertility  a Marital  a Marriage  a Pregnancy  aJournal Article  g46g4h785-803tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1080177&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200901982naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450105001671000024002727000023002961100041003197100048003605200825004086500069012336500038013026510007013406530011013476530012013586530016013706550020013867730030014068560006014368560196014429030018016381080178  a201001       200911                        eng     aEP44876815  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD31  aI1210aIncome Inequality and Self-Rated Health Status: Evidence from the European Community Household Panel10aHildebrand, Vincent10aVan Kerm, Philippe  aYork U and CEPS-INSTEAD, Differdange  aCEPS-INSTEAD, Differdange and ISER, U Essex  aWe examine the effect of income inequality on individuals' self-rated health status in a pooled sample of 11 countries, using longitudinal data from the European Community Household Panel survey. Taking advantage of the longitudinal and cross-national nature of our data, and carefully modeling the self-reported health information, we avoid several of the pitfalls suffered by earlier studies on this topic. We calculate income inequality indices measured at two standard levels of geography (NUTS-0 and NUTS-1) and find consistent evidence that income inequality is negatively related to self-rated health status in the European Union for both men and women, particularly when measured at national level. However, despite its statistical significance, the magnitude of the impact of inequality on health is very small. 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aEU  aHealth  a Income  a Inequality  aJournal Article  g46g4h805-25tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1080178&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200903318naa  2200493   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001830430008001912450099001991000023002987000020003217000024003411100024003657100016003897100024004055201387004296500038018166500076018546500118019306500109020486500055021576500172022126510063023846530017024476530018024646530012024826530013024946530015025076530021025226530011025436550020025547730030025748560006026048560196026109030018028061080179  a201001       200911                        eng     aEP44876816  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aO13  aO15  aQ51  aR2310aWhat Explains the Rural-Urban Gap in Infant Mortality: Household or Community Characteristics?10aVan de Poel, Ellen10aO'Donnell, Owen10aVan Doorslaer, Eddy  aErasmus U Rotterdam  aU Macedonia  aErasmus U Rotterdam  aThe rural-urban gap in infant mortality rates is explained by using a new decomposition method that permits identification of the contribution of unobserved heterogeneity at the household and the community level. Using Demographic and Health Survey data for six Francophone countries in Central and West sub-Saharan Africa, we find that differences in the distributions of factors that determine mortality--not differences in their effects--explain almost the entire gap. Higher infant mortality rates in rural areas mainly derive from the rural disadvantage in household characteristics, both observed and unobserved, which explain two-thirds of the gap. Among the observed characteristics, environmental factors--a safe source of drinking water, electricity, and quality of housing materials--are the most important contributors. Community characteristics explain less than one-quarter of the gap, with about two-thirds of this coming from community unobserved heterogeneity and one-third from the existence of a health facility within the community. The effect of disadvantageous environmental conditions--such as limited electricity and water supply--derives both from a lack of community-level infrastructure and from the inability of some households to exploit it when available. Policy needs to operate at both the community and household levels to correct such deficiencies. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Agriculture; Natural Resources; Energy; Environment; Other Primary Products         b(O13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aValuation of Environmental Effects         b(Q51) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aBenin; Central African Republic; Chad; Guinea; Mali; Niger  aDemographics  a Distribution  a Health  a Infants  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  a Water  aJournal Article  g46g4h827-50tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1080179&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200902372naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450084001671000019002517000023002701100009002937100009003025201197003116500038015086500108015466510009016546530011016636530013016746530012016876530015016996530013017146530013017276550020017407730030017608560006017908560196017969030018019921080180  a201001       200911                        eng     aEP44876817  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1410aMortality Attributable to Obesity among Middle-Aged Adults in the United States10aMehta, Neil K.10aChang, Virginia W.  aU MI  aU PA  aObesity is considered a major cause of premature mortality and a potential threat to the longstanding secular decline in mortality in the United States. We measure relative and attributable risks associated with obesity among middle-aged adults using data from the Health and Retirement Study (1992-2004). Although class II/III obesity (BMI >= 35.0 kg/m[superscript 2]) increases mortality by 40% in females and 62% in males compared with normal BMI (BMI = 18.5-24.9), class I obesity (BMI = 30.0-34.9) and being overweight (BMI = 25.0-29.9) are not associated with excess mortality. With respect to attributable mortality, class II/III obesity (BMI >= 35.0) is responsible for approximately 4% of deaths among females and 3% of deaths among males. Obesity is often compared with cigarette smoking as a major source of avoidable mortality. Smoking-attributable mortality is much larger in this cohort: about 36% in females and 50% in males. Results are robust to confounding by preexisting diseases, multiple dimensions of socioeconomic status (SES), smoking, and other correlates. These findings challenge the viewpoint that obesity will stem the long-term secular decline in U.S. mortality. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Disease  a Health  a Mortality  a Obesity  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g46g4h851-72tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1080180&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200902103naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450088001831000019002717000024002901100009003147100009003235200828003326500070011606500077012306500084013076500068013916510009014596530017014686550020014857730030015058560006015358560196015419030016017371062873  a200910       200908                        eng     aEP43381346  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aC43  aJ11  aJ12  aJ2110aRevisiting Das Gupta: Refinement and Extension of Standardization and Decomposition10aChevan, Albert10aSutherland, Michael  aU MA  aU MA  aStandardization and decomposition are established and widely used demographic techniques for comparing rates and means between groups with differences in composition. The difference in rates and means has heretofore been resolved in terms of the contribution of variables to compositional effects for each variable and an overall rate effect. This study demonstrates that the resolution of differences is attainable at the categorical level for both compositional effects and rate effects. Refinements to Das Gupta's equations yield a complete decomposition because of the additivity of categorical compositional and rate effects. Other refinements allow the decomposition of polytomous variables. Extensions to the method provide for the decomposition of the standard deviation and the multivariate index of dissimilarity. 4aIndex Numbers and Aggregation; Leading indicators         b(C43) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aLabor Force and Employment, Size, and Structure         b(J21)  aU.S.  aDemographics  aJournal Article  g46g3h429-49tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1062873&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200902400naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450063001911000022002541100023002765200843002996500117011426500117012596500084013766500076014606500066015366510011016026530010016136530014016236530012016376530023016496530012016726530015016846530011016996550020017107730030017308560006017608560196017669030016019621062874  a200910       200908                        eng     aEP43381347  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aH23  aI38  aJ12  aJ13  aJ1610aFamily Allowances and Fertility: Socioeconomic Differences10aSchellekens, Jona  aHebrew U Jerusalem  aThis article explores socioeconomic differences in the effect of family allowances on fertility. Although several studies have examined the relationship between cash benefits and fertility, few studies have addressed the possible differential effects of cash benefits on families of different income or education levels. I reconstructed the birth histories of women in the past two Israeli censuses of 1983 and 1995 to study socioeconomic differences in the effect of family allowances up to the seventh parity. The results indicate that family allowances have a significant effect at every parity. Using female education as an indicator of socioeconomic status, I find that socioeconomic status is a significant modifier of the effect of family allowances. Family allowances seem to have a relatively large impact on more-educated women. 4aTaxation and Subsidies: Externalities; Redistributive Effects; Environmental Taxes and Subsidies         b(H23) 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aIsrael  aBirth  a Families  a Family  a Family Allowances  a Female  a Fertility  a Women  aJournal Article  g46g3h451-68tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1062874&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200902835naa  2200493   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450095001911000018002867000021003041100009003257100009003345201221003436500113015646500066016776500053017436500065017966500041018616510009019026530017019116530020019286530014019486530016019626530018019786530009019966530012020056530010020176530014020276530021020416530011020626550020020737730030020938560006021238560196021299030016023251062875  a200910       200908                        eng     aEP43381348  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aJ16  aJ22  aJ31  aJ7110aEmployment Gains and Wage Declines: The Erosion of Black Women's Relative Wages since 198010aPettit, Becky10aEwert, Stephanie  aU WA  aU WA  aPublic policy initiatives in the 1950s and 1960s, including Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity law, helped mitigate explicit discrimination in pay, and the expansion of higher education and training programs have advanced the employment fortunes of many American women. By the early 1980s, some scholars proclaimed near equity in pay between black and white women, particularly among young and highly skilled workers. More recent policy initiatives and labor market conditions have been arguably less progressive for black women's employment and earnings: through the 1980s, 1990s, and the first half of the 2000s, the wage gap between black and white women widened considerably. Using data from the Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (CPS-MORG), this article documents the racial wage gap among women in the United States from 1979 to 2005. We investigate how demographic and labor market conditions influence employment and wage inequality among black and white women over the period. Although shifts in labor supply influence the magnitude of the black-white wage gap among women, structural disadvantages faced by black women help explain the growth in the racial wage gap. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Discrimination  a Earnings  a Inequality  a Labor Supply  a Pay  a Racial  a Wage  a Wage Gap  a Wage Inequality  a Women  aJournal Article  g46g3h469-92tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1062875&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200902144naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450096001751000019002711100056002905200996003466500076013426500053014186500083014716510009015546530010015636550020015737730031015938560006016248560196016309030016018261062876  a200910       200908                        eng     aEP43381349  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ22  aJ2410aJob Opportunities, Economic Resources, and the Postsecondary Destinations of American Youth10aBozick, Robert  aAcademy for Educational Development, Washington, DC  aUsing a nationally representative sample of graduates from the high school class of 2003-2004, I test the warehouse hypothesis, which contends that youth are more likely to leave school and enter the labor force when there are available job opportunities (and vice versa). Using two measures of job opportunities--local unemployment rates and the percentage of local workers employed in jobs that require a bachelor's degree--I find support for the warehouse hypothesis. In areas where unemployment is low, with ample jobs that do not require a bachelor's degree, youth have higher odds of entering the labor force. In areas where unemployment is high, with few jobs that require only a high school diploma, youth have higher odds of entering college. The effect of unemployment on enrollment is more pronounced for low-income youth than for high-income youth, with both low- and high-income youth turning to four-year schools rather than two-year schools when job opportunities are limited. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24)  aU.S.  aYouth  aJournal Article  g46g3h493-512tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1062876&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200902326naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450106001751000024002811100015003055201154003206500042014746500077015166500113015936510009017066530014017156530015017296550020017447730030017648560006017948560196018009030016019961062877  a200910       200908                        eng     aEP43381350  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ11  aJ1510aParental Characteristics and the Schooling Progress of the Children of Immigrant and U.S.-Born Blacks10aThomas, Kevin J. A.  aPA State U  aIn this study, I examine disparities in schooling progress among children born to immigrant and U.S.-born blacks. I find that in one- and two-parent families, children born to black immigrants are less likely to fall behind in school than those born to U.S.-born blacks. In two-parent immigrant families, children born to two immigrant parents have a significant schooling advantage over children born to one immigrant parent. While children born to two immigrant parents in the wealthiest black immigrant families do better in the second generation than in the first, the reverse is observed among children in less wealthy families. These findings contribute in two ways to our understanding of the assimilation processes of children born to black immigrant parents. First, they show that there is a positive association between the number of immigrant parents in a family and children's schooling performance. Second, they suggest that disparities in the assimilation patterns of the children of black immigrants are a likely product of the interaction between their parental characteristics and the socio-economic circumstances of their families. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g46g3h513-34tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1062877&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200902017naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450040001751000021002157000022002361100043002587100032003015200815003336500083011486500068012316500065012996510009013646530014013736530024013876550020014117730030014318560006014618560196014679030016016631062878  a200910       200908                        eng     aEP43381351  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ24  aJ28  aJ6110aDo Immigrants Work in Riskier Jobs?10aOrrenius, Pia M.10aZavodny, Madeline  aFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas and IZA  aAgnes Scott College and IZA  aRecent media and government reports suggest that immigrants are more likely to hold jobs with poor working conditions than U.S.-born workers, perhaps because immigrants work in jobs that "natives don't want." Despite this widespread view, earlier studies have not found immigrants to be in riskier jobs than natives. This study combines individual-level data from the 2003-2005 American Community Survey with Bureau of Labor Statistics data on work-related injuries and fatalities to take a fresh look at whether foreign-born workers are employed in more dangerous jobs. The results indicate that immigrants are in fact more likely to work in risky jobs than U.S.-born workers, partly due to differences in average characteristics, such as immigrants' lower English-language ability and educational attainment. 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aSafety; Job Satisfaction; Related Public Policy         b(J28) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  a Working Conditions  aJournal Article  g46g3h535-51tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1062878&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200902749naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450083001751000018002587000025002767000021003011100014003227100053003367100011003895201304004006500042017046500084017466500076018306510011019066530010019176530015019276530014019426530013019566530015019696530014019846530012019986530013020106530012020236550020020357730030020558560006020858560196020919030016022871062879  a200910       200908                        eng     aEP43381352  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ12  aJ1310aConsequences of Family Disruption on Children's Educational Outcomes in Norway10aSteele, Fiona20aSigle-Rushton, Wendy10aKravdal, Oystein  aU Bristol  aLondon School of Economics and Political Science  aU Oslo  aUsing high-quality data from Norwegian population registers, we examine the relationship between family disruption and children's educational outcomes. We distinguish between disruptions caused by parental divorce and paternal death and, using a simultaneous equation model, pay particular attention to selection bias in the effect of divorce. We also allow for the possibility that disruption may have different effects at different stages of a child's educational career. Our results suggest that selection on time-invariant maternal characteristics is important and works to overstate the effects of divorce on a child's chances of continuing in education. Nevertheless, the experience of marital breakdown during childhood is associated with lower levels of education, and the effect weakens with the child's age at disruption. The effects of divorce are most pronounced for the transitions during or just beyond the high school level. In models that do not allow for selection, children who experienced a father's death appear less disadvantaged than children whose parents divorced. After we control for selection, however, differences in the educational qualifications of children from divorced and bereaved families narrow substantially and, at mean ages of divorce, are almost non-existent. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aNorway  aChild  a Childhood  a Children  a Divorce  a Education  a Families  a Family  a Marital  a Parent  aJournal Article  g46g3h553-74tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1062879&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200902890naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450110001911000017003017000019003181100018003377100018003555201233003736500038016066500077016446500101017216500123018226500101019456510022020466530011020686530013020796530015020926530015021076530021021226530017021436530016021606550020021767730030021968560006022268560196022329030016024281062880  a200910       200908                        eng     aEP43381353  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ11  aP21  aP23  aP2610aForced Migration and Mortality in the Very Long Term: Did Perestroika Affect Death Rates Also in Finland?10aSaarela, Jan10aFinnas, Fjalar  aAbo Akademi U  aAbo Akademi U  aIn this article, we analyze mortality rates of Finns born in areas that were ceded to the Soviet Union after World War II and from which the entire population was evacuated. These internally displaced persons are observed during the period 1971-2004 and compared with people born in the same region but on the adjacent side of the new border. We find that in the 1970s and 1980s, the forced migrants had mortality rates that were on par with those of people in the comparison group. In the late 1980s, the mortality risk of internally displaced men increased by 20% in relation to the expected time trend. This deviation, which manifests particularly in cardiovascular mortality, coincides with perestroika and the demise of the Soviet Union, which were events that resulted in an intense debate in civil society about restitution of the ceded areas. Because state actors were reluctant to engage, the debate declined after some few years, and after the mid-1990s, the death risk again approached the long-term trend. Our findings indicate that when internally displaced persons must adjust to situations for which appropriate coping behaviors are unknown, psychosocial stress might arise several decades after their evacuation. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Planning, Coordination, and Reform         b(P21) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population         b(P23) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Political Economy; Property Rights         b(P26)  aFinland; U.S.S.R.  aDeaths  a Migrant  a Migration  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  a Perestroika  a Population  aJournal Article  g46g3h575-87tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1062880&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200903249naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450074001831000020002577000020002777000018002977000024003157000022003391100038003617100038003997100038004377100038004757100038005135201447005516500107019986500077021056500166021826500163023486510009025116530011025206530015025316550020025467730031025668560006025978560196026039030016027991062881  a200910       200908                        eng     aEP43381354  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aC81  aJ11  aN31  aN3210aDrawing Statistical Inferences from Historical Census Data, 1850-195010aDavern, Michael10aRuggles, Steven10aSwenson, Tami10aAlexander, J.

Such data can yield standard error estimates that differ dramatically from those derived from a simple random sample of the same size. Researchers using historical U.S. census microdata, however, usually apply methods designed for simple random samples. The resulting p values and confidence intervals could be inaccurate and could lead to erroneous research conclusions. Because U.S. census microdata samples are among the most widely used sources for social science and policy research, the need for reliable standard error estimation is critical. We evaluate the historical microdata samples of the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) project from 1850 to 1950 in order to determine (1) the impact of sample design on standard error estimates, and (2) how to apply modern standard error estimation software to historical census samples. We exploit a unique new data source from the 1880 census to validate our methods for standard error estimation, and then we apply this approach to the 1850-1870 and 1900-1950 decennial censuses. We conclude that Taylor series estimation can be used effectively with the historical decennial census microdata samples and should be applied in research analyses that have the potential for substantial clustering effects. 4aMethodology for Collecting, Estimating, and Organizing Microeconomic Data; Data Access         b(C81) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Microdata  aJournal Article  g46g3h589-603tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1062881&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200902929naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450119001831000013003027000028003151100024003437100014003675201470003816500052018516500038019036500084019416500108020256510009021336530015021426530012021576530013021696530012021826530017021946530013022116530015022246550020022397730030022598560006022898560196022959030016024911062882  a200910       200908                        eng     aEP43381355  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI11  aI12  aJ12  aJ1410aInvestigating the Mechanism of Marital Mortality Reduction: The Transition to Widowhood and Quality of Health Care10aJin, Lei10aChristakis, Nicholas A.  aChinese U Hong Kong  aHarvard U  aWhile it is well known that the widowed suffer increased mortality risks, the mechanism of this survival disadvantage is still under investigation. In this article, we examine the quality of health care as a possible link between widowhood and mortality using a unique data set of 475,313 elderly couples who were followed up for up to nine years. We address whether the transition to widowhood affects the quality of care that individuals receive and explore the extent to which these changes mediate the elevated mortality hazard for the widowed. We analyze six established measures of quality of health care in a fixed-effect framework to account for unobserved heterogeneity. Caregiving and acute bereavement during the transition to widowhood appear to distract individuals from taking care of their own health care needs in the short run. However, being widowed does not have long-term detrimental effects on individuals' ability to sustain contact with the formal medical system. Moreover, the short-run disruption does not mediate the widowhood effect on mortality. Nevertheless, long after spousal death, men suffer from a decline in the quality of informal care, coordination between formal and informal care, and the ability to advocate and communicate in formal medical settings. These findings illustrate women's centrality in the household production of health and identify important points of intervention in optimizing men's adjustment to widowhood. 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aCaregiving  a Deaths  a Elderly  a Health  a Health Care  a Marital  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g46g3h605-25tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1062882&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200902896naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450083001591000024002427000021002667000020002877000020003077000021003271100045003487100009003937100045004027100073004477100016005205201561005366500108020976510009022056530010022146530016022246530014022406550020022547730030022748560006023048560196023109030016025061062883  a200910       200908                        eng     aEP43381356  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1410aChange in Disability-Free Life Expectancy for Americans 70 Years Old and Older10aCrimmins, Eileen M.10aHayward, Mark D.10aHagedorn, Aaron10aSaito, Yasuhiko10aBrouard, Nicolas  aAndrus Gerontology Center, U Southern CA  aU TX  aAndrus Gerontology Center, U Southern CA  aAdvanced Research Institute for the Sciences and Humanities, Nihon U  aINED, Paris  aIn this article, we examine changes in life expectancy free of disability using longitudinal data collected from 1984 through 2000 from two cohorts who composed the Longitudinal Studies of Aging I and II. Life expectancies with and without ADL and/or IADL disability are calculated using a Markov-based multistate life table approach. At age 70, disability-free life expectancy increased over a 10-year period by 0.6 of a year in the later cohort, which was the same as the increase in total life expectancy, both increases marginally statistically significant. The average length of expected life with IADL and ADL disability did not change. Changes in disability-free life expectancy resulted from decreases in disability incidence and increases in the incidence of recovery from disability across the two survey cohorts. Age-specific mortality among the ADL disabled declined significantly in the later cohort after age 80. Mortality for the IADL disabled and the nondisabled did not change significantly. Those with ADL disability at age 70 experienced substantial increases in both total life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy. These results indicate the importance of efforts both to prevent and delay disability and to promote recovery from disability for increasing life expectancy without disability. Results also indicate that while reductions in incidence and increases in recovery work to decrease population prevalence of disability, declining mortality among the disabled has been a force toward increasing disability prevalence. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aAging  a Disability  a Disabled  aJournal Article  g46g3h627-46tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1062883&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200901913naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450049001671000021002161100019002375201001002566500038012576500078012956510009013736550020013827730030014028560006014328560196014389030013016341051857  a200908       200905                        eng     aEP37806548  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ6410aJob Loss and Health in the U.S. Labor Market10aStrully, Kate W.  aU Albany, SUNY  aWhile U.S. unemployment rates remain low, rates of job loss are high and rising. Job loss is also becoming increasingly common in more advantaged, white-collar occupations. This article is concerned with how these patterns impact the health of U.S. workers. Drawing on recent data from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I find that job loss harms health, beyond sicker people being more likely to lose their jobs. Respondents who lost jobs but were reemployed at the survey faced an increased risk of developing new health conditions; they were not, however, more likely to describe their health in negative terms. This suggests that recent job "churning" within the United States (i.e., high rates of job loss but low unemployment) may impact certain health outcomes but not others. I find no evidence that the health consequences of job loss differ across white- and blue- collar occupations, although health-related selection out of jobs appears stronger within the bluecollar category. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aUnemployment: Models, Duration, Incidence, and Job Search         b(J64)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g46g2h221-46tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1051857&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200901988naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450105001671000023002727000021002951100024003167100015003405200909003556500084012646500076013486510009014246550020014337730030014538560006014838560196014899030013016851051858  a200908       200905                        eng     aEP37806549  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aUnwed Fathers' Ability to Pay Child Support: New Estimates Accounting for Multiple-Partner Fertility10aSinkewicz, Marilyn10aGarfinkel, Irwin  aU MI and Columbia U  aColumbia U  aWe present new estimates of unwed fathers' ability to pay child support. Prior research relied on surveys that drastically undercounted nonresident unwed fathers and provided no link to their children who lived in separate households. To overcome these limitations, previous research assumed assortative mating and that each mother partnered with one father who was actually eligible to pay support and had no other child support obligations. Because the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study contains data on couples, multiple-partner fertility, and a rich array of other previously unmeasured characteristics of fathers, it is uniquely suited to address the limitations of previous research. We also use an improved method of dealing with missing data. Our findings suggest that previous research overestimated the aggregate ability of unwed nonresident fathers to pay child support by 33% to 60%. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g46g2h247-63tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1051858&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200902334naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450092001751000026002671100009002935201244003026500084015466500076016306500064017066510009017706550020017797730030017998560006018298560196018359030013020311051859  a200908       200905                        eng     aEP37806550  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ13  aK4210aParental Imprisonment, the Prison Boom, and the Concentration of Childhood Disadvantage10aWildeman, Christopher  aU MI  aAlthough much research has focused on how imprisonment transforms the life course of disadvantaged black men, researchers have paid little attention to how parental imprisonment alters the social experience of childhood.

This article also estimates the risk of parental imprisonment for children whose parents did not finish high school, finished high school only, or attended college. Results show the following: (1) 1 in 40 white children born in 1978 and 1 in 25 white children born in 1990 had a parent imprisoned; (2) 1 in 7 black children born in 1978 and 1 in 4 black children born in 1990 had a parent imprisoned; (3) inequality in the risk of parental imprisonment between white children of college-educated parents and all other children is growing; and (4) by age 14, 50.5% of black children born in 1990 to high school dropouts had a father imprisoned. These estimates, robustness checks, and extensions to longitudinal data indicate that parental imprisonment has emerged as a novel--and distinctively American--childhood risk that is concentrated among black children and children of low-education parents. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aIllegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law         b(K42)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g46g2h265-80tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1051859&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200902336naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450068001671000023002357000028002587000018002867000024003041100028003287100016003567100016003727100016003885201154004046500084015586500076016426510014017186550020017327730031017528560006017838560196017899030013019851051860  a200908       200905                        eng     aEP37806551  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aNature's Experiment?

In this article, we contribute to this literature by investigating the effect of handedness on child development. This is an important issue given that around 10% of the world's population is left-handed and given recent research demonstrating that child development strongly affects adult outcomes. Using a large, nationally representative sample of young children, we find that the probability of a child being left-handed is not significantly related to child health at birth, family composition, parental employment, or household income. We also find robust evidence that left-handed (and mixed-handed) children perform significantly worse in nearly all measures of development than right-handed children, with the relative disadvantage being larger for boys than girls. Importantly, these differentials cannot be explained by different socioeconomic characteristics of the household, parental attitudes, or investments in learning resources. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aAustralia  aJournal Article  g46g2h281-301tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1051860&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200902209naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450117001751000018002927000020003101100016003307100016003465201031003626500038013936500076014316500109015076510014016166550020016307730030016508560006016808560196016869030013018821051861  a200908       200905                        eng     aEP37806552  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aO1510aIs the Relationship between Socioeconomic Status and Health Stronger for Older Children in Developing Countries?10aCameron, Lisa10aWilliams, Jenny  aU Melbourne  aU Melbourne  aRecent research on the relationship between child health and income in developed countries reveals a positive gradient that is more pronounced for older children, suggesting that the impact of income upon health accumulates. This article examines whether the same is true in a developing country. Using data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey on children aged 0 to 14 years, we find that although low income adversely affects health, its impact does not differ by age. This finding is robust to the use of both subjective and objective health measures, controlling for selective mortality, the use of alternative measures of households' resources, and the inclusion of indicators of health at birth and parental health. One explanation for the constancy of the health-income relationship that we explore is the dominant role played by acute illness in determining the general health status of children in a developing-country context compared with the more central role played by chronic conditions in developed countries. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aIndonesia  aJournal Article  g46g2h303-24tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1051861&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200902455naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450059001831000017002421100014002595201303002736500038015766500077016146500066016916500109017576510010018666550020018767730030018968560006019268560196019329030013021281051862  a200908       200905                        eng     aEP37806553  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ11  aJ16  aO1510aProximate Sources of Population Sex Imbalance in India10aOster, Emily  aU Chicago  aThere is a population sex imbalance in India. Despite a consensus that this imbalance is due to excess female mortality, the specific source of this excess mortality remains poorly understood. I use microdata on child survival in India to analyze the proximate sources of the sex imbalance. I address two questions: when in life does the sex imbalance arise, and what health or nutritional investments are specifically responsible for its appearance? I present a new methodology that uses microdata on child survival. This methodology explicitly takes into account both the possibility of naturally occurring sex differences in survival and possible differences between investments in their importance for survival. Consistent with existing literature, I find significant excess female mortality in childhood, particularly between the ages of 1 and 5, and argue that the sex imbalance that exists by age 5 is large enough to explain virtually the entire imbalance in the population. Within this age group, sex differences in vaccinations explain between 20% and 30% of excess female mortality, malnutrition explains an additional 20%, and differences in treatment for illness play a smaller role. Together, these investments account for approximately 50% of the sex imbalance in mortality in India. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aIndia  aJournal Article  g46g2h325-39tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1051862&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200902342naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450161001831000018003447000019003621100009003817100009003905201091003996500066014906500053015566500065016096500041016746510024017156550020017397730030017598560006017898560196017959030013019911051863  a200908       200905                        eng     aEP37806554  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aJ22  aJ31  aJ7110aMotherhood, Labor Force Behavior, and Women's Careers: An Empirical Assessment of the Wage Penalty for Motherhood in Britain, Germany, and the United States10aGangl, Markus10aZiefle, Andrea  aU WI  aU WI  aUsing harmonized longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), we trace career prospects after motherhood for five cohorts of American, British, and West German women around the 1960s. We establish wage penalties for motherhood between 9% and 18% per child, with wage losses among American and British mothers being lower than those experienced by mothers in Germany. Labor market mechanisms generating the observed wage penalty for motherhood differ markedly across countries, however. For British and American women, work interruptions and subsequent mobility into mother-friendly jobs fully account for mothers' wage losses. In contrast, respective penalties are considerably smaller in Germany, yet we observe a substantial residual wage penalty that is unaccounted for by mothers' observable labor market behavior. We interpret this finding as indicating a comparatively more pronounced role for statistical discrimination against mothers in the German labor market. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71)  aGermany; U.K.; U.S.  aJournal Article  g46g2h341-69tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1051863&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200901984naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450088001671000021002557000020002761100043002967100013003395200922003526500038012746500108013126510009014206550020014297730030014498560006014798560196014859030013016811051864  a200908       200905                        eng     aEP37806555  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1410aModeling Transition Rates Using Panel Current-Status Data: How Serious Is the Bias?10aWolf, Douglas A.10aGill, Thomas M.  aCenter for Policy Research, Syracuse U  aUnlisted  aStudies of disability dynamics and active life expectancy often rely on transition rates or probabilities that are estimated using panel survey data in which respondents report on current health or functional status. If respondents are contacted at intervals of one or two years, then relatively short periods of disability or recovery between surveys may be missed. Much published research that uses such data assumes that there are no unrecorded transitions, applying event-history techniques to estimate transition rates. In recent years, a different approach based on embedded Markov chains has received growing use. We assessed the performance of both approaches, using as a criterion their ability to reproduce the parameters of a "true" model based on panel data collected at one-month intervals. Neither of the widely used approaches performs particularly well, and neither is uniformly superior to the other. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g46g2h371-86tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1051864&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200901680naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450046001671000020002131100039002335200753002726500038010256500076010636510009011396550020011487730031011688560006011998560196012059030013014011051865  a200908       200905                        eng     aEP37806556  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1310aReconstructing Childhood Health Histories10aSmith, James P.  aRAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aThis article provides evidence about the quality of retrospective childhood health histories given to respondents in the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Even though information on early life health events is critical, there is legitimate skepticism about the ability of older respondents to remember specific health problems that they had during childhood. The evidence presented in this article suggests that this view is too negative. Respondents appear to remember salient childhood events about themselves, such as the illnesses they had during childhood, quite well. Moreover, these physical and psychological childhood health events are important correlates of adult health during middle age. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g46g2h387-403tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1051865&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200902635naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450068001751000019002431100015002625201486002776500059017636500077018226500172018996510009020716550020020807730030021008560006021308560196021369030013023321051866  a200908       200905                        eng     aEP37806557  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aC53  aJ11  aR2310aCan Knowledge Improve Population Forecasts at Subcounty Levels?10aChi, Guangqing  aMS State U  aRecent developments in urban and regional planning require more accurate population forecasts at subcounty levels, as well as a consideration of interactions among population growth, traffic flow, land use, and environmental impacts. However, the extrapolation methods, currently the most often used demographic forecasting techniques for subcounty areas, cannot meet the demand. This study tests a knowledge-based regression approach, which has been successfully used for forecasts at the national level, for subcounty population forecasting. In particular, this study applies four regression models that incorporate demographic characteristics, socioeconomic conditions, transportation accessibility, natural amenities, and land development to examine the population change since 1970 and to prepare the 1990-based forecast of year 2000 population at the minor civil division level in Wisconsin. The findings indicate that this approach does not outperform the extrapolation projections. Although the regression methods produce more precise projections, the least biased projections are often generated by one of the extrapolation techniques. The performance of the knowledge-based regression methods is discounted at subcounty levels by temporal instability and the scale effect. The regression coefficients exhibit a statistically significant level of temporal instability across the estimation and projection periods and tend to change more rapidly at finer geographic scales. 4aForecasting Models; Simulation Methods         b(C53) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g46g2h405-27tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1051866&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200902929naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450076001911000019002677000021002867000021003071100031003287100073003597100025004325201236004576500038016936500077017316500048018086500160018566500172020166510010021886530012021986530015022106530014022256550020022397730028022598560006022878560196022939030018024891037020  a200905       200902                        eng     aEP36168689  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ11  aJ45  aN33  aR2310aHeight and the Normal Distribution: Evidence from Italian Military Data10aA'Hearn, Brian10aPeracchi, Franco10aVecchi, Giovanni  aPembroke College, U Oxford  aU Rome 'Tor Vergata' and Einaudi Institute for Economics and Finance  aU Rome 'Tor Vergata'  aResearchers modeling historical heights have typically relied on the restrictive assumption of a normal distribution, only the mean of which is affected by age, income, nutrition, disease, and similar influences. To avoid these restrictive assumptions, we develop a new semiparametric approach in which covariates are allowed to affect the entire distribution without imposing any parametric shape. We apply our method to a new database of height distributions for Italian provinces, drawn from conscription records, of unprecedented length and geographical disaggregation. Our method allows us to standardize distributions to a single age and calculate moments of the distribution that are comparable through time. Our method also allows us to generate counterfactual distributions for a range of ages, from which we derive age-height profiles. These profiles reveal how the adolescent growth spurt (AGS) distorts the distribution of stature, and they document the earlier and earlier onset of the AGS as living conditions improved over the second half of the nineteenth century. Our new estimates of provincial mean height also reveal a previously unnoticed "regime switch" from regional convergence to divergence in this period. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aPublic Sector Labor Markets         b(J45) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Europe: Pre-1913         b(N33) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aItaly  aDisease  a Nutrition  a Regional  aJournal Article  g46g1h1-25tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1037020&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200902621naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450105001591000021002647000022002857000022003071100015003297100009003447100009003535201472003626500038018346510009018726530011018816530014018926530013019066530012019196530019019316530015019506530013019656550020019787730029019988560006020278560196020339030018022291037021  a200905       200902                        eng     aEP36168690  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1210aPredicting Adult Health and Mortality from Adolescent Facial Characteristics in Yearbook Photographs10aReither, Eric N.10aHauser, Robert M.10aSwallen, Karen C.  aUT State U  aU WI  aU WI  aSeveral important longitudinal studies in the social sciences have omitted biomarkers that are routinely recorded today, including height and weight. To account for this shortcoming in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), an 11-point scale was developed to code high school senior class yearbook photographs of WLS participants for relative body mass (RBM). Our analyses show that although imperfect, the RBM scale is reliable (a = .91) and meets several criteria of validity as a measure of body mass. Measured at ages 17-18, the standardized relative body mass index (SRBMI) was moderately correlated (r = .31) with body mass index (BMI) at ages 53-54 and with maximum BMI reported between ages 16 and 30 (r = .48). Overweight adolescents (> 90th percentile of SRBMI) were about three times more likely than healthy-weight adolescents (10th-80th percentile of SRBMI) to be obese in adulthood and, as a likely consequence, significantly more likely to report health problems such as chest pain and diabetes. Overweight adolescents also suffered a twofold risk of premature death from all nonaccidental causes as well as a fourfold risk of heart disease mortality. The RBM scale has removed a serious obstacle to obesity research and lifelong analyses of health in the WLS. We suggest that other longitudinal studies may also be able to obtain photos of participants at younger ages and thus gain a prospectively useful substitute for direct measures of body mass. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Diabetes  a Disease  a Health  a Heart Disease  a Mortality  a Obesity  aJournal Article  g46g1h27-41tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1037021&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200901288naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450082001751000017002577000022002741100062002967100065003586500038004236500084004616500109005456510011006546530013006656530015006786550020006937730029007138560006007428560196007489030018009441037022  a200905       200902                        eng     aEP36168691  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ12  aO1510aMarriage Behavior Response to Prime-Age Adult Mortality: Evidence from Malawi10aUeyama, Mika10aYamauchi, Futoshi  aJapan International Cooperation Agency Research Institute  aInternational Food Policy Research Institute, Washington, DC 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMalawi  aMarriage  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g46g1h43-63tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1037022&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200902293naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450086001671000024002537000022002777000023002991100027003227100009003497100032003585201074003906500076014646500113015406510009016536530009016626530015016716550020016867730029017068560006017358560196017419030018019371037023  a200905       200902                        eng     aEP36168692  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1510aBayesian Estimation of Hispanic Fertility Hazards from Survey and Population Data10aRendall, Michael S.10aHandcock, Mark S.10aJonsson, Stefan H.  aRAND, Santa Monica, CA  aU WA  aHealth Institute of Iceland  aPrevious studies have demonstrated both large gains in efficiency and reductions in bias by incorporating population information in regression estimation with sample survey data. These studies, however, assumed that the population values are exact. This assumption is relaxed here through a Bayesian extension of constrained maximum likelihood estimation applied to U.S. Hispanic fertility. The Bayesian approach allows for the use of both auxiliary survey data and expert judgment in making adjustments to published Hispanic Population fertility rates, and for the estimation of uncertainty about these adjustments. Compared with estimation from sample survey data only, the Bayesian constrained estimator results in much greater precision in the age pattern of the baseline fertility hazard and therefore of the predicted values for any given combination of socioeconomic variables. The use of population data in combination with survey data may therefore be highly advantageous even when the population data are known to have significant levels of nonsampling error. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aBias  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g46g1h65-83tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1037023&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200902567naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450104001671000020002717000022002911100026003137100026003395201316003656500084016816500076017656510009018416530015018506530014018656530012018796530013018916530012019046530019019166550020019357730030019558560006019858560196019919030018021871037024  a200905       200902                        eng     aEP36168693  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aFamily Boundary Ambiguity and the Measurement of Family Structure: The Significance of Cohabitation10aBrown, Susan L.10aManning, Wendy D.  aBowling Green State U  aBowling Green State U  aWe used data from the first wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine family boundary ambiguity in adolescent and mother reports of family structure and found that the greater the family complexity, the more likely adolescent and mother reports of family structure were discrepant. This boundary ambiguity in reporting was most pronounced for cohabiting stepfamilies. Among mothers who reported living with a cohabiting partner, only one-third of their teenage children also reported residing in a cohabiting stepfamily. Conversely, for those adolescents who reported their family structure as a cohabiting stepfamily, just two-thirds of their mothers agreed. Levels of agreement between adolescents and mothers about residing in a two-biological-parent family, single-mother family, or married stepfamily were considerably higher. Estimates of the distribution of adolescents across family structures vary according to whether adolescent, mother, or combined reports are used. Moreover, the relationship between family structure and family processes differed depending on whose reports of family structure were used, and boundary ambiguity was associated with several key family processes. Family boundary ambiguity presents an important measurement challenge for family scholars. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAdolescent  a Children  a Family  a Mothers  a Parent  a Single Mother  aJournal Article  g46g1h85-101tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1037024&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200902745naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450127001671000024002947000020003187000020003381100009003587100015003677100009003825201497003916500076018886500098019646510009020626530015020716530018020866530021021046550020021257730030021458560006021758560196021819030018023771037025  a200905       200902                        eng     aEP36168694  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aZ1310aBirds of a Feather, or Friend of a Friend? Using Exponential Random Graph Models to Investigate Adolescent Social Networks10aGoodreau, Steven M.10aKitts, James A.10aMorris, Martina  aU WA  aColumbia U  aU WA  aIn this article, we use newly developed statistical methods to examine the generative processes that give rise to widespread patterns in friendship networks. The methods incorporate both traditional demographic measures on individuals (age, sex, and race) and network measures for structural processes operating on individual, dyadic, and triadic levels. We apply the methods to adolescent friendship networks in 59 U.S. schools from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). We model friendship formation as a selection process constrained by individuals' sociality (propensity to make friends), selective mixing in dyads (friendships within race, grade, or sex categories are differentially likely relative to cross-category friendships), and closure in triads (a friend's friends are more likely to become friends), given local population composition. Blacks are generally the most cohesive racial category, although when whites are in the minority, they display stronger selective mixing than do blacks when blacks are in the minority. Hispanics exhibit disassortative selective mixing under certain circumstances; in other cases, they exhibit assortative mixing but lack the higher-order cohesion common in other groups. Grade levels are always highly cohesive, while females form triangles more than males. We conclude with a discussion of how network analysis may contribute to our understanding of sociodemographic structure and the processes that create it. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aU.S.  aAdolescent  a Demographics  a Social Networks  aJournal Article  g46g1h103-25tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1037025&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200902103naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450103001671000022002707000019002921100009003117100009003205200943003296500063012726500172013356510009015076530015015166550020015317730030015518560006015818560196015879030018017831037026  a200905       200902                        eng     aEP36168695  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aQ54  aR2310aFleeing the Storm(s): An Examination of Evacuation Behavior during Florida's 2004 Hurricane Season10aSmith, Stanley K.10aMcCarty, Chris  aU FL  aU FL  aThe 2004 hurricane season was the worst in Florida's history, with four hurricanes causing at least 47 deaths and some $45 billion in damages. In order to collect information on the demographic impact of those hurricanes, we surveyed households throughout the state and in the local areas sustaining the greatest damage. We estimate that one-quarter of Florida's population evacuated prior to at least one hurricane; in some areas, well over half the residents evacuated at least once and many evacuated several times. Most evacuees stayed with family or friends and were away from home for only a few days. With continued population growth in coastal areas and the apparent increase in hurricane activity caused by global warming, the threats posed by hurricanes are rising in the United States and throughout the world. We believe the present study will help government officials plan more effectively for future hurricanes evacuations. 4aClimate; Natural Disasters; Global Warming         b(Q54) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aPopulation  aJournal Article  g46g1h127-45tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1037026&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200903010naa  2200493   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450118001911000021003097000016003307000019003467000020003651100009003857100017003947100009004117100017004205201263004376500076017006500066017766500065018426500065019076500172019726510015021446530010021596530011021696530014021806530012021946530015022066530014022216530011022356550020022467730030022668560006022968560196023029030018024981037027  a200905       200902                        eng     aEP36168696  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ16  aJ31  aJ61  aR2311aA Longitudinal Analysis of Family Migration and the Gender Gap in Earnings in the United States and Great Britain10aCooke, Thomas J.10aBoyle, Paul10aCouch, Kenneth10aFeijten, Peteke  aU CT  aU St Andrews  aU CT  aU St Andrews  aThis article uses longitudinal data for the United States and Great Britain to examine the impact of residential mobility and childbirth on the earnings of women, their family earnings, and the related division of earnings by gender. This project is the first to compare explicitly the impact of childbirth and family migration on women's earnings, and it extends prior cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on isolated countries by providing a direct contrast between two major industrialized nations, using comparable measures. The results indicate that families respond in similar ways in both countries to migration and childbirth. In response to both migration and childbirth, women's earnings fall at the time of the event and recover slowly afterward, but the magnitude of the impact is roughly twice as large for childbirth as for migration. However, migration--but not the birth of a child--is also associated with a significant increase in total family earnings because of increased husbands' earnings. As a result, the effect of migration on the relative earnings of wives to husbands is similar to the effect of childbirth. These results suggest that family migration should be given consideration in the literature on the gender earnings gap. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.K.; U.S.  aBirth  a Child  a Earnings  a Gender  a Migration  a Mobility  a Women  aJournal Article  g46g1h147-67tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1037027&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200901859naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450068001591000025002271100017002525200966002696500077012356510009013126530014013216550020013357730030013558560006013858560196013919030018015871037028  a200905       200902                        eng     aEP36168697  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1110aDual Citizenship Rights: Do They Make More and Richer Citizens?10aMazzolari, Francesca  aU CA, Irvine  aIn the 1990s, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Brazil passed dual citizenship laws granting their expatriates the right to naturalize in the receiving country without losing their nationality of origin. I estimate the effects of these new laws on naturalization rates and labor market outcomes in the United States. Based on data from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. censuses, I find that immigrants recently granted dual nationality rights are more likely to naturalize relative to immigrants from other Latin American countries. They also experience relative employment and earnings gains, together with drops in welfare use, suggesting that dual citizenship rights not only increase the propensity to naturalize but may also promote economic assimilation. The effects of dual citizenship on improved economic performance, if mediated through naturalization, are consistent with American citizenship conferring greater economic opportunities. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  aJournal Article  g46g1h169-91tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1037028&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200902027naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450077001671000018002441100056002625200929003186500084012476500076013316510009014076530010014166530015014266530013014416550020014547730031014748560006015058560196015119030018017071037029  a200905       200902                        eng     aEP36168698  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1313aThe Rising Share of Nonmarital Births: Is It Only Compositional Effects?10aErmisch, John  aInstitute for Social and Economic Research, U Essex  aA recent article by Gray, Stockard, and Stone contended that the increase in the proportion of births to unmarried women since 1974 in the United States was not caused by any major change in underlying fertility behavior, but rather by a decrease in the proportion of women who are married, which increased both the population at risk and the birth rate of unmarried women relative to that of married women. In this comment, I argue that the statistical test of this explanation used in the article is invalid because the variables in the analysis are not stationary time series. Correct statistical tests reject the explanation. In particular, I demonstrate persistent, nonstationary deviations from the relationships predicted by the theory advanced by Gray et al. For long periods, the proportion unmarried played only a small role in the changes in the ratio of nonmarital to marital birth rates, contrary to the theory. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Fertility  a Marital  aJournal Article  g46g1h193-202tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1037029&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200901751naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450079001671000019002461100009002655200697002746500084009716500076010556510009011316530010011406530015011506530014011656550020011797730030011998560006012298560196012359030018014311037030  a200905       200902                        eng     aEP36168699  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aComment: There May Be Compositional Effects, but They Do Not Work That Way10aMartin, Steven  aU MD  aThis analysis joins the debate on how declines in marriage have shifted the composition of the unmarried and married populations in the United States, and how compositional shifts have affected nonmarital birth rates. Gray, Stockard, and Stone (2006) presented one model for compositional effects that Ermisch (2009) challenged with alternative statistical tests. I propose an alternative model for compositional shifts based not on theory but on observed marriage and fertility patterns. The results from this alternative model are consistent with Ermisch's findings yet support Gray et al.'s general case that compositional effects have had an important influence on nonmarital birth rates. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Fertility  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g46g1h203-08tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1037030&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200901471naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450058001671000020002251100008002455200487002536500084007406500076008246510009009006530014009096550020009237730030009438560006009738560196009799030018011751037031  a200905       200902                        eng     aEP36168700  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aComposition and Decomposition in Nonmarital Fertility10aWu, Lawrence L.  aNYU  aErmisch (2009) criticized Gray, Stockard, and Stone (2006), arguing that they incorrectly tested a model positing a nonlinear relationship between the nonmarital fertility ratio and the proportion of unmarried women.

Three sets of formal comments, authored independently by Ermisch, Martin, and Wu (EMW), appear in this issue of Demography. In this response, we argue that the analysis and evidence of our 2006 paper have withstood the scrutiny of EMW. In particular, we find that a substantial part of the rising share of nonmarital births since 1970 is due to a selection effect associated with marriage. This same selection effect also explains how birth rates could rise in both groups, even though their combined birth rate did not. In sum, though we appreciate the opportunity to expand on several key aspects of our 2006 article, we see no reason to substantially revise any of our major conclusions based on the EMW comments. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Demography  a Fertility  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g46g1h211-19tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1037032&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200902106naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450065001591000020002241100036002445201218002806500051014986530017015496530016015666550020015827730030016028560006016328560196016389030018018341011569  a200901       200811                        eng     aEP34944970  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1010aWhen to Promote, and When to Avoid, a Population Perspective10aDuncan, Greg J.  aNorthwestern U and U CA, Irvine  aDemography's population perspective, and the sampling methods that help produce it, are powerful but underutilized research tools. The first half of this article makes the case for more vigorous promotion of a population perspective throughout the sciences. It briefly reviews the basic elements of population sampling and then provides examples from both developed and developing countries of how population sampling can enrich random-assignment policy experiments, multisite studies, and qualitative research. At the same time, an ill-considered application of a population perspective to the problem of causal inference can hinder social and behavioral science. The second half of the article describes the "slippery slope " by which some demographic studies slide from providing a highly useful description about the population to using regressions to estimate causal models for that population. It then suggests that causal modeling is sometimes well served by a highly selective look at small subsets of a population with interesting variability in independent variables of interest. A robust understanding of causal effects, however, rests on convergence between selective and population-wide perspectives. 4aDemographic Economics: General         b(J10)  aDemographics  a Demography  aJournal Article  g45g4h763-84tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1011569&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200802888naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450065001831000020002487000021002687000023002891100070003127100019003827100092004015201317004936500165018106500038019756500077020136500066020906510016021566530017021726530016021896530014022056550020022197730031022398560006022708560196022769030018024721011570  a200901       200811                        eng     aEP34944971  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aC22  aI12  aJ11  aJ1611aA Decomposition Method Based on a Model of Continuous Change10aHoriuchi, Shiro10aWilmoth, John R.10aPletcher, Scott D.  aHunter College, CUNY and Institute for Demographic Research, CUNY  aU CA, Berkeley  aHuffington Center on Aging and Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine  aA demographic measure is often expressed as a deterministic or stochastic function of multiple variables (covariates), and a general problem (the decomposition problem) is to assess contributions of individual covariates to a difference in the demographic measure (dependent variable) between two populations. We propose a method of decomposition analysis based on an assumption that covariates change continuously along an actual or hypothetical dimension. This assumption leads to a general model that logically justifies the additivity of covariate effects and the elimination of interaction terms, even if the dependent variable itself is a nonadditive function. A comparison with earlier methods illustrates other practical advantages of the method: in addition to an absence of residuals or interaction terms, the method can easily handle a large number of covariates and does not require a logically meaningful ordering of covariates. Two empirical examples show that the method can be applied flexibly to a wide variety of decomposition problems. This study also suggests that when data are available at multiple time points over a long interval, it is more accurate to compute an aggregated decomposition based on multiple subintervals than to compute a single decomposition for the entire study period. 4aSingle Equation Models; Single Variables: Time-Series Models; Dynamic Quantile Regressions; Dynamic Treatment Effect Models; Diffusion Processes         b(C22) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.; Japan  aDemographics  a Population  a Residual  aJournal Article  g45g4h785-801tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1011570&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200803405naa  2200577   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450075001911000022002667000019002887000028003077000015003357000019003507000016003691100052003857100017004377100028004547100035004827100028005177100025005455201282005706500076018526500066019286500109019946500119021036500172022226510010023946530017024046530026024216530015024476530015024626530013024776530016024906530011025066530011025176530018025286530011025466550020025577730030025778560006026078560196026139030018028091011571  a200901       200811                        eng     aEP34944972  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ16  aO15  aO18  aR2310aUrbanization and Fertility: An Event-History Analysis of Coastal Ghana10aWhite, Michael J.10aMuhidin, Salut10aAndrzejewski, Catherine10aTagoe, Eva10aKnight, Rodney10aReed, Holly  aPopulation Studies and Training Center, Brown U  aU Queensland  aPrincipia International  aU Science and Technology-Ghana  aPrincipia International  aQueens College, CUNY  aIn this article, we undertake an event-history analysis of fertility in Ghana. We exploit detailed life history calendar data to conduct a more refined and definitive analysis of the relationship among personal traits, urban residence, and fertility. Although urbanization is generally associated with lower fertility in developing countries, inferences in most studies have been hampered by a lack of information about the timing of residence in relationship to childbearing. We find that the effect of urbanization itself is strong, evident, and complex, and persists after we control for the effects of age, cohort, union status, and education. Our discrete-time event-history analysis shows that urban women exhibit fertility rates that are, on average, 11% lower than those of rural women, but the effects vary by parity. Differences in urban population traits would augment the effects of urban adaptation itself. Extensions of the analysis point to the operation of a selection effect in rural-to-urban mobility but provide limited evidence for disruption effects. The possibility of further selection of urbanward migrants on unmeasured traits remains. The analysis also demonstrates the utility of an annual life history calendar for collecting such data in the field. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aGhana  aChildbearing  a Developing Countries  a Education  a Fertility  a Migrant  a Population  a Rural  a Urban  a Urbanization  a Women  aJournal Article  g45g4h803-16tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1011571&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200802052naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450075001671000019002421100026002615200953002876500076012406500066013166510009013826530013013916530011014046530015014156530015014306530011014456550020014567730030014768560006015068560196015129030018017081011572  a200901       200811                        eng     aEP34944973  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1610aFertility Effects of Abortion and Birth Control Pill Access for Minors10aGuldi, Melanie  aMount Holyoke College  aThis article empirically assesses whether age-restricted access to abortion and the birth control pill influence minors' fertility in the United States. There is not a strong consensus in previous literature regarding the relationship between laws restricting minors' access to abortion and minors' birthrates. This is the first study to recognize that state laws in place prior to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision enabled minors to legally consent to surgical treatment--including abortion--in some states but not in others, and to construct abortion access variables reflecting this. In this article, age-specific policy variables measure either a minor's legal ability to obtain an abortion or to obtain the birth control pill without parental involvement. I find fairly strong evidence that young women's birthrates dropped as a result of abortion access as well as evidence that birth control pill access led to a drop in birthrates among whites. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aAbortion  a Birth  a Birthrate  a Fertility  a Women  aJournal Article  g45g4h817-27tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1011572&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200802777naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450034001911000021002251100009002465201380002556500084016356500066017196500065017856500065018506500081019156510009019966530013020056530015020186530014020336530027020476530012020746530011020866550020020977730030021178560006021478560196021539030018023491011573  a200901       200811                        eng     aEP34944974  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ16  aJ31  aJ61  aJ6210aSpousal Mobility and Earnings10aMcKinnish, Terra  aU CO  aAn important finding in the literature on migration has been that the earnings of married women typically decrease with a move, while the earnings of married men often increase with a move, suggesting that married women are more likely to act as the "trailing spouse." This article considers a related but largely unexplored question: what is the effect of having an occupation that is associated with frequent migration on the migration decisions of a household and on the earnings of the spouse? Further, how do these effects differ between men and women? The Public Use Microdata Sample from the 2000 U.S. decennial census is used to calculate migration rates by occupation and education. The analysis estimates the effects of these occupational mobility measures on the migration of couples and the earnings of married individuals. I find that migration rates in both the husband's and wife's occupations affect the household migration decision, but mobility in the husband's occupation matters considerably more. For couples in which the husband has a college degree (regardless of the wife's educational level), a husband's mobility has a large, significant negative effect on his wife's earnings, whereas a wife's mobility has no effect on her husband's earnings. This negative effect does not exist for college-educated wives married to non-college-educated husbands. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aJob, Occupational, and Intergenerational Mobility; Promotion         b(J62)  aU.S.  aEarnings  a Migration  a Mobility  a Occupational Mobility  a Spouse  a Women  aJournal Article  g45g4h829-49tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1011573&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200802496naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450077001831000018002607000028002781100009003067100014003155201133003296500038014626500084015006500108015846500066016926510009017586530009017676530012017766530013017886530015018016530012018166550020018287730030018488560006018788560196018849030018020801011574  a200901       200811                        eng     aEP34944975  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ12  aJ14  aJ1610aWives and Ex-wives: A New Test for Homogamy Bias in the Widowhood Effect10aElwert, Felix10aChristakis, Nicholas A.  aU WI  aHarvard U  aIncreased mortality following the death of a spouse (the "widowhood effect") may be due to (I) causation, (2) bias from spousal similarity (homogamy), or (3) bias from shared environmental exposures. This article proposes new tests for bias in the widowhood effect by examining husbands, wives, and ex-wives in a longitudinal sample of over I million elderly Americans. If the death of an ex-wife has no causal effect on the mortality of her husband, then an observed association between the mortality of an ex-wife and her husband may indicate bias, while the absence of an effect of an ex-wife's death on her husband's mortality would discount the possibility of homogamy bias (and also of one type of shared-exposure bias). Results from three empirical tests provide strong evidence for an effect of a current wife's death on her husband's mortality yet no statistically significant evidence for an effect of an ex-wife s death on her husband's mortality. These results strengthen the causal interpretation of the widowhood effect by suggesting that the widowhood effect is not due to homogamy bias to any substantial degree. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aBias  a Deaths  a Elderly  a Mortality  a Spouse  aJournal Article  g45g4h851-73tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1011574&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200802460naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450062001591000024002217000020002451100113002657100008003785201344003866500084017306510009018146530012018236530014018356530013018496530014018626550020018767730030018968560006019268560196019329030018021281011575  a200901       200811                        eng     aEP34944976  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aNo Trend in the Intergenerational Transmission of Divorce10aLi, Jui-Chung Allen10aWu, Lawrence L.  aInstitute of European and American Studies, Academia Sinica and Population Research Centre, RAND Corporation  aNYU  aPrevious studies on trends in the intergenerational transmission of divorce have produced mixed findings, with two studies (McLanahan and Bumpass 1988; Teachman 2002) reporting no trend in divorce transmission and one study (Wolfinger 1999) finding that divorce transmission has weakened substantially. Using a stratified Cox proportional hazard model, we analyze data from the National Survey of Families and Households and find no evidence for any trend in divorce transmission. To reconcile apparent differences in results, we note that the General Social Survey data used by Wolfinger lack information on marital duration, permitting analysis only for whether respondents have divorced by interview. As a result, an apparent decline in divorce transmission could be due to inadequate adjustments for the longer exposures to risk by earlier marriage cohorts, yielding a higher probability of divorce by interview for earlier cohorts relative to more recent cohorts even if divorce risks are identical across all marriage cohorts. We confirm this possibility by using a series of discrete-time hazard logistic regressions to investigate the sensitivity of estimates of trends in divorce transmission to different adjustments for exposure to risk. We conclude that there has been no trend in the intergenerational transmission of divorce. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aDivorce  a Families  a Marital  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g45g4h875-83tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1011575&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200802524naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450071001831000018002547000021002721100009002937100014003025201085003166500052014016500076014536500113015296500066016426510009017086530013017176530011017306530011017416530014017526530012017666530012017786530015017906530014018056550020018197730031018398560006018708560196018769030018020721011576  a200901       200811                        eng     aEP34944977  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI11  aJ13  aJ15  aJ1610aPrenatal Health Investment Decisions: Does the Child's Sex Matter?10aLhila, Aparna10aSimon, Kosali I.  aU GA  aCornell U  aIndividuals invest in their own health, but children rely on parents to act on their behalf, especially in the case of prenatal health. In this article, we ask, Do parents in the United States who choose to give birth allocate resources differently in the prenatal health of their sons and daughters when the sex of the child is known in advance? We pay special attention to prenatal health behaviors, which can be viewed as investment decisions, of first-generation immigrant parents from India and China, two countries with demonstrated son preference. Ultrasound receipt proxies for knowing fetal gender, enabling us to separate child sex-related biological differences from investment differences in sons' and daughters' health. There is evidence consistent with sex-selective abortions among Indian and Chinese populations, but among parents who choose to carry the pregnancy to term, our findings do not suggest that knowledge of child sex drives prenatal health investments in the United States, neither in the population as a whole nor among Indian and Chinese immigrants. 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aAbortion  a Birth  a Child  a Children  a Gender  a Health  a Pregnancy  a Prenatal  aJournal Article  g45g4h885-905tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1011576&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200802300naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450081001751000022002561100012002785201084002906500108013746500066014826500109015486510010016576530011016676530015016786530011016936550020017047730030017248560006017548560196017609030018019561011577  a200901       200811                        eng     aEP34944978  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ14  aJ16  aO1510aGender, Resources across the Life Course, and Cognitive Functioning in Egypt10aYount, Kathryn M.  aEmory U  aIn this article, I evaluate the life-course determinants of cognitive functioning among 1,003 women and men aged 50 and older in Ismailia, Egypt. Three questions motivate this analysis: (1) Do older women have poorer cognitive functioning than do older men?; (2) Do cognitive resources accrued in childhood and adulthood have net positive associations with later-life cognitive functioning for women and men?; and (3) To what extent do differences in the amounts and effects of women's and men's cognitive resources account for gaps in their cognitive functioning? Compared with men, women have lower Modified-Mini Mental Status Exam (M-MMSE) scores for overall cognitive functioning. Cognitive resources in childhood and adulthood are jointly associated with the M-MMSE score. About 83% of the gender gap in mean M-MMSE scores is attributable to gaps in men's and women's attributes across the life course. Gender gaps in childhood cognitive resources--and especially schooling attainment--account for the largest share (18%) of the residual gender gap in cognitive functioning. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aEgypt  aGender  a Schooling  a Women  aJournal Article  g45g4h907-26tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=1011577&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200800463naa  2200133   4500001001100000008004400011022001300055245001200068655002200080773001000102856000600112856019900118903001200317EP33662729       200808                        eng     a0070337010aERRATA.  aCorrection notice  g45g3  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=EP33662729&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAug200802493naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450060001671000021002271100015002485201378002636500113016416500172017546510009019266530011019356550020019467730031019668560006019978560196020039030016021990998952  a200811       200808                        eng     aEP33662730  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aR2313aThe Geographic Scale of Metropolitan Racial Segregation10aReardon, Sean F.  aStanford U  aThis article addresses an aspect of racial residential segregation that has been largely ignored in prior work: the issue of geographic scale. In some metropolitan areas, racial groups are segregated over large regions, with predominately white regions, predominately black regions, and so on, whereas in other areas, the separation of racial groups occurs over much shorter distances. Here we develop an approach--featuring the segregation profile and the corresponding macro/micro segregation ratio--that offers a scale-sensitive alternative to standard methodological practice for describing segregation. Using this approach, we measure and describe the geographic scale of racial segregation in the 40 largest U.S. metropolitan areas in 2000. We find considerable heterogeneity in the geographic scale of segregation patterns across both metropolitan areas and racial groups, a heterogeneity that is not evident using conventional "aspatial" segregation measures. Moreover, because the geographic scale of segregation is only modestly correlated with the level of segregation in our sample, we argue that geographic scale represents a distinct dimension of residential segregation. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our findings for investigating the patterns, causes, and consequences of residential segregation at different geographic scales. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aRacial  aJournal Article  g45g3h489-514tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0998952&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200802580naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450134001751000025003091100009003345201284003436500056016276500113016836500172017966510009019686530009019776530012019866550020019987730030020188560006020488560196020549030016022500998953  a200811       200808                        eng     aEP33662731  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI32  aJ15  aR2310aReexamining the Moving to Opportunity Study and Its Contribution to Changing the Distribution of Poverty and Ethnic Concentration10aClark, William A. V.  aUCLA  aFor the past decade and a half, a concerted effort has been undertaken to determine whether policy interventions in residential location can solve the problems of inner-city poverty and racial concentration. Studies based on data from the Gautreaux litigation and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-sponsored Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program have provided an overall optimistic interpretation of the possibilities of improving inner-city lives via mobility vouchers and counseling. A reanalysis of the data from the MTO program, focusing specifically on African American households, suggests greater caution in the interpretation of the findings from either Gautreaux or the MTO program. No statistically significant difference exists between the percentage of poor or the percentage of African Americans in the current neighborhoods between MTO and Section 8 experimental groups. In some cases, there is no statistically significant difference between those who move with a voucher and those who move without any assistance at all. Although there is some evidence that MTO programs have brought specific gains for individual families, claims for the MTO program as a whole need to be treated with a great deal more caution than they have been to date. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aPoor  a Racial  aJournal Article  g45g3h515-35tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0998953&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200802428naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450047001751000018002227000017002401100022002577100013002795201244002926500056015366500076015926500066016686510009017346530010017436530014017536530018017676530013017856550020017987730030018188560006018488560196018549030016020500998954  a200811       200808                        eng     aEP33662732  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI32  aJ13  aJ1610aChild Poverty and Changes in Child Poverty10aChen, Wen-Hao10aCorak, Miles  aStatistics Canada  aU Ottawa  aThis article offers a cross-country overview of child poverty, changes in child poverty, and the impact of public policy in North America and Europe. Levels and changes in child poverty rates in 12 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries during the 1990s are documented using data from the Luxembourg Income Study project, and a decomposition analysis is used to uncover the relative role of demographic factors, labor markets, and income transfers from the state in determining the magnitude and direction of the changes. Child poverty rates fell noticeably in only three countries and rose in three others. In no country were demographic factors a force for higher child poverty rates, but these factors were also limited in their ability to cushion children from adverse shocks originating in the labor market or the government sector. Increases in the labor market engagement of mothers consistently lowered child poverty rates, while decreases in the employment rates and earnings of fathers were a force for higher rates. Finally, there is no single road to lower child poverty rates. Reforms to income transfers intended to increase labor supply may or may not end up lowering the child poverty rate. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aOECD  aChild  a Children  a Demographics  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g45g3h537-53tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0998954&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200801655naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450057001591000022002161100009002385200730002476500084009776510009010616530013010706530014010836530012010976550020011097730030011298560006011598560196011659030016013610998955  a200811       200808                        eng     aEP33662733  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aMate Availability and Unmarried Parent Relationships10aHarknett, Kristen  aU PA  aTheoretically, a shortage of males in a local marriage market may influence the formation, quality, and trajectory of unmarried parent relationships. To test these hypotheses, I combine city-level sex ratio data from the U.S. census with microdata on unmarried couples who recently had a child from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study. A shortage of men in a marriage market is associated with lower relationship quality for unmarried parents. Male shortages are associated with lower rates of marriage following a nonmarital birth, in part because of the mediating influence of relationship quality. A shortage of men is not significantly related to the economic quality of male, nonmarital childbearing partners. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aFamilies  a Marriage  a Parent  aJournal Article  g45g3h555-71tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0998955&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200802225naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450058001591000027002177000019002441100017002637100009002805201280002896500084015696510009016536530017016626550020016797730030016998560006017298560196017359030016019310998956  a200811       200808                        eng     aEP33662734  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aGay and Lesbian Partnership: Evidence from California10aCarpenter, Christopher10aGates, Gary J.  aU CA, Irvine  aUCLA  aMuch recent research on sexual minorities has used couples-based samples, which--by construction--provide no information on nonpartnered individuals. We present the first systematic empirical analysis of partnership and cohabitation among self-identified gay men and lesbians using two independent, large, population-based data sources from California. These data indicate that 37%-46% of gay men and 5l%-62% of lesbians aged 18-59 are in cohabiting partnerships (compared with 62% of heterosexual individuals in coresidential unions at comparable ages). Unlike previous research, we find that white and highly educated gay men and lesbians are more likely to be partnered, and we confirm that same-sex cohabiting partners in our data have demographic characteristics that are similar to California same-sex couples from Census 2000. We also present the first detailed analysis of officially registered domestic partnerships in California. We find that almost half of partnered lesbians are officially registered with the local or state government, while less than a quarter of partnered gay men are officially registered. We conclude with implications of our findings for couples-based research on gay men and lesbians, as well as recommendations for survey data collection. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aDemographics  aJournal Article  g45g3h573-90tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0998956&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200803126naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450087001831000017002701100014002875201644003016500065019456500119020106500172021296500098023016510013023996530012024126530015024246530011024396530020024506530013024706550020024837730031025038560006025348560196025409030016027360998957  a200811       200808                        eng     aEP33662735  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ61  aO18  aR23  aZ1310aSocial Capital and Migration: How Do Similar Resources Lead to Divergent Outcomes?10aGarip, Filiz  aHarvard U  aThis article investigates how migrant social capital differentially influences individuals' migration and cumulatively generates divergent outcomes for communities. To combine the fragmented findings in the literature, the article proposes a framework that decomposes migrant social capital into resources (information about or assistance with migration), sources (prior migrants), and recipients (potential migrants). Analysis of multilevel and longitudinal data from 22 rural villages in Thailand shows that the probability of internal migration increases with the available resources, yet the magnitude of increase depends on recipients' characteristics and the strength of their ties to sources. Specifically, individuals become more likely to migrate if migrant social capital resources are greater and more accessible. The diversity of resources by occupation increases the likelihood of migration, while diversity by destination inhibits it. Resources from weakly tied sources, such as village members, have a higher effect on migration than resources from strongly tied sources in the household. Finally, the importance of resources for migration declines with recipients' own migration experience. These findings challenge the mainstream account of migrant social capital as a uniform resource that generates similar migration outcomes for different groups of individuals or in different settings. In Nang Rong villages, depending on the configuration of resources, sources, and recipients, migrant social capital leads to differential migration outcomes for individuals and divergent cumulative migration patterns in communities. 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aThailand  aMigrant  a Migration  a Rural  a Social Capital  a Village  aJournal Article  g45g3h591-617tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0998957&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200802969naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450084001831000018002677000019002851100015003047100017003195201501003366500113018376500083019506500065020336500041020986510009021396530019021486530014021676530015021816530019021966530016022156530015022316530011022466530010022576550020022677730030022878560006023178560196023239030016025190998958  a200811       200808                        eng     aEP33662736  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aJ24  aJ31  aJ7110aDoes Human Capital Raise Earnings for Immigrants in the Low-Skill Labor Market?10aHall, Matthew10aFarkas, George  aPA State U  aU CA, Irvine  aWe use monthly Survey of Income and Program Participation data from 1996-1999 and 2001-2003 to estimate the determinants of differentiation in intercepts and slopes for age/earnings profiles of low-skill immigrant and native male workers. Our findings provide further depth of understanding to the "mixed" picture of earnings determination in the low-skill labor market that has been reported by others. On the positive side, many immigrants are employed in similar occupations and industries as natives. Both groups show substantial wage gains over time and generally receive similar returns to years of schooling completed. Immigrants also receive substantial returns to acculturation, measured as age at arrival and English language skill. These results cast doubt on the strong version of segmented labor market theory, in which low-skill immigrants are permanently consigned to dead-end jobs with no wage appreciation. On the negative side, immigrants earn approximately 24% less than natives and are less likely to occupy supervisory and managerial jobs. Latino immigrants receive lower returns to education than do white immigrants. Furthermore, age at arrival and language ability do not explain the lower returns to education experienced by Latino immigrants. These results suggest that Latino immigrants in particular may suffer from barriers to mobility and/or wage discrimination. Whether these negative labor market experiences occur primarily for illegal immigrants remains unknown. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71)  aU.S.  aDiscrimination  a Earnings  a Education  a Human Capital  a Occupation  a Schooling  a Skill  a Wage  aJournal Article  g45g3h619-39tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0998958&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200802371naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450058001751000018002331100014002515201090002656500077013556500076014326500108015086510011016166530021016276530011016486530011016596530013016706530015016836530015016986530016017136550020017297730030017498560006017798560196017859030016019810998959  a200811       200808                        eng     aEP33662737  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ13  aJ1410aMigration, Fertility, and Aging in Stable Populations10aAlho, Juha M.  aU Joensuu  aFertility is below replacement level in all European countries, and population growth is expected to decline in the coming decades. Increasing life expectancy will accentuate concomitant aging of the population. Migration has been seen as a possible means to decelerate aging. In this article, I introduce a stable, open-population model in which cohort net migration is proportional to births. In this case, the migration-fertility trade-off can be studied with particular ease. I show that although migration can increase the growth rate, which tends to make the age distribution younger, it also has an opposite effect because of its typical age pattern. I capture the effect of the age pattern of net migration in a migration-survivor function. The effect of net migration on growth is quantified with data from 17 European countries. I show that some countries already have a level of migration that will lead to stationarity. For other countries with asymptotically declining population, migration still provides opportunities for slowing down aging of the population as a whole. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aEurope  aAge Distribution  a Aging  a Birth  a Cohorts  a Fertility  a Migration  a Population  aJournal Article  g45g3h641-50tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0998959&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200802447naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450093001751000023002687000022002911100011003137100011003245201217003356500076015526500113016286500066017416510009018076530014018166530011018306550020018417730030018618560006018918560196018979030016020930998960  a200811       200808                        eng     aEP33662738  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ15  aJ1610aIntergenerational Fertility among Hispanic Women: New Evidence of Immigrant Assimilation10aParrado, Emilio A.10aMorgan, S.

If confirmed, continued high Hispanic fertility could indicate a broader lack of assimilation into mainstream American society. In this paper, we reexamine the issue of Hispanic and Mexican fertility using an approach that combines biological and immigrant generations to more closely approximate a comparison of immigrant women with those of their daughters' and granddaughters' generation. Contrary to cross-sectional results, our new analyses show that Hispanic and Mexican fertility is converging with that of whites, and that it is similarly responsive to period conditions and to women's level of education. In addition, we employ a mathematical simulation to illustrate the conditions under which cross-sectional analyses can produce misleading results. Finally, we discuss the import of the fertility convergence we document for debates about immigrant assimilation. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aFertility  a Women  aJournal Article  g45g3h651-71tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0998960&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200802611naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450072001751000023002471100017002705201329002876500038016166500108016546500109017626510029018716530012019006530013019126530012019256530015019376530013019526530016019656550020019817730030020018560006020318560196020379030016022330998961  a200811       200808                        eng     aEP33662739  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ14  aO1513aThe Exceptionally High Life Expectancy of Costa Rican Nonagenarians20aRosero-Bixby, Luis  aU Costa Rica  aRobust data from a voter registry show that Costa Rican nonagenarians have an exceptionally high live expectancy. Mortality at age 90 in Costa Rica is at least 14% lower than an average of 13 high-income countries. This advantage increases with age by 1% per year. Males have an additional 12% advantage. Age-90 life expectancy for males is 4.4 years, one-half year more than any other country in the world. These estimates do not use problematic data on reported ages, but ages are computed from birth dates in the Costa Rican birth-registration ledgers. Census data confirm the exceptionally high survival of elderly Costa Ricans, especially males. Comparisons with the United States and Sweden show that the Costa Rican advantage comes mostly from reduced incidence of cardiovascular diseases, coupled with a low prevalence of obesity, as the only available explanatory risk factor. Costa Rican nonagenarians are survivors of cohorts that underwent extremely harsh health conditions when young, and their advantage might be just a heterogeneity in frailty effect that might disappear in more recent cohorts. The availability of reliable estimates for the oldest-old in low-income populations is extremely rare. These results may enlighten the debate over how harsh early-life health conditions affect older-age mortality. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aCosta Rica; U.S.; Sweden  aDisease  a Elderly  a Health  a Mortality  a Obesity  a Population  aJournal Article  g45g3h673-91tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0998961&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200802807naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450147001831000019003301100011003495201369003606500042017296500084017716500076018556500109019316510014020406530013020546530026020676530017020936530012021106530015021226530015021376550020021527730031021728560006022038560196022099030016024050998962  a200811       200808                        eng     aEP33662740  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ12  aJ13  aO1513aThe Changing Relationship between Family Size and Educational Attainment over the Course of Socioeconomic Development: Evidence from Indonesia10aMaralani, Vida  aYale U  aMany studies from developed countries show a negative correlation between family size and children's schooling, while results from developing countries show this association ranging from positive to neutral to negative, depending on the context. The body of evidence suggests that this relationship changes as a society develops, but this theory has been difficult to assess because the existing evidence requires comparisons across countries with different social structures and at different levels of development. The world's fourth most populous nation in 2007, Indonesia has developed rapidly in recent decades. This context provides the opportunity to study these relationships within the same rapidly developing setting to see if and how these associations change. Results show that in urban areas, the association between family size and children's schooling was positive for older cohorts but negative for more recent cohorts. Models using instrumental variables to address the potential endogeneity of fertility confirm these results. In contrast, rural areas show no significant association between family size and children's schooling for any cohort. These findings show how the relationship between family size and children s schooling can differ within the same country and change over time as contextual factors evolve with socioeconomic development. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aIndonesia  aChildren  a Developing Countries  a Development  a Family  a Fertility  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g45g3h693-717tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0998962&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200802327naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450117001671000023002847000022003071100009003297100009003385201240003476500042015876500076016296510009017056530013017146530018017276550020017457730030017658560006017958560196018019030016019970998963  a200811       200808                        eng     aEP33662741  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ1310aHave We Put an End to Social Promotion? Changes in School Progress among Children Aged 6 to 17 from 1972 to 200510aFrederick, Carl B.10aHauser, Robert M.  aU WI  aU WI  aWe examine trends over time in the proportion of children below the modal grade for their age (BMG), a proxy for grade retention, and in the effects of its demographic and socioeconomic correlates. We estimate a logistic regression model with partial constraints predicting BMG using the annual October school enrollment supplements of the Current Population Survey. This model identifies systematic variation in the effects of social background across age and time from 1972 to 2005. While the effects of socioeconomic background variables on progress through school have become increasingly powerful as children grow older, that typical pattern has been attenuated across the past three decades by a steady secular decline in the influence of those variables across all ages. A great deal of concern has been expressed about rising levels of economic and social inequality in the United States since the middle 1970s, and about the potential intergenerational effects of such inequality. However, there has been an opposite trend in the effects of social origins on being BMG. A trend is not a law, and there is reason to be concerned about the recent deceleration of the secular decline in effects of social background on being BMG. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Demographics  aJournal Article  g45g3h719-40tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0998963&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200802149naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450054001751000018002297000026002471100015002737100016002885200873003046500038011776500042012156500088012576510009013456530011013546530013013656530015013786530012013936530015014056530021014206530015014416530015014566550020014717730030014918560006015218560196015279030016017230998964  a200811       200808                        eng     aEP33662742  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aI21  aO3310aTechnological Innovation and Inequality in Health10aGlied, Sherry20aLleras-Muney, Adriana  aColumbia U  aPrinceton U  aThe effect of education on health has been increasing over the past several decades. We hypothesize that this increasing disparity is related to health-related technical progress: more-educated people are the first to take advantage of technological advances that improve health. We test this hypothesis using data on disease-specific mortality rates for 1980 and 1990, and cancer registry data for 1973-1993. We estimate education gradients in mortality using compulsory schooling as a measure of education. We then relate these gradients to two measures of health-related innovation: the number of active drug ingredients available to treat a disease, and the rate of change in mortality from that disease. We find that more-educated individuals have a greater survival advantage in those diseases for which there has been more health-related technological progress. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aTechnological Change: Choices and Consequences; Diffusion Processes         b(O33)  aU.S.  aCancer  a Disease  a Education  a Health  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  a Schooling  a Technical  aJournal Article  g45g3h741-61tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0998964&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200802840naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450084001831000019002677000020002861100009003067100009003155201512003246500042018366500113018786500041019916500109020326510010021416530019021516530015021706530016021856550020022017730030022218560006022518560196022579030013024530984960  a200808       200805                        eng     aEP31816626  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ15  aJ71  aO1510aChanging Educational Inequalities in India in the Context of Affirmative Action10aDesai, Sonalde10aKulkarni, Veena  aU MD  aU MD  aIndian society suffers from substantial inequalities in education, employment, and income based on caste and ethnicity. Compensatory or positive discrimination policies reserve 15% of the seats in institutions of higher education and state and central government jobs for people of the lowest caste, the Scheduled Caste; 7.5% of the seats are reserved for the Scheduled Tribe. These programs have been strengthened by improved enforcement and increased funding in the 1990s. This positive discrimination has also generated popular backlash and on-the-ground sabotage of the programs. This paper examines the changes in educational attainment between various social groups for a period of nearly 20 years to see whether educational inequalities have declined over time. We use data from a large national sample survey of over 100,000 households for each of the four survey years--1983, 1987-1988, 1993-1994, and 1999-2000--and focus on the educational attainment of children and young adults aged 6-29. Our results show a declining gap between dalits, adivasis, and others in the odds of completing primary school. Such improvement is not seen for Muslims, a minority group that does not benefit from affirmative action. We find little improvement in inequality at the college level. Further, we do not find evidence that upper-income groups, the so-called creamy layer of dalits and adivasis, disproportionately benefit from the affirmative action programs at the expense of their lower-income counterparts. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aIndia  aDiscrimination  a Education  a Inequality  aJournal Article  g45g2h245-70tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0984960&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200801545naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450073001751000014002481100009002625200347002716500076006186500109006946500123008036510010009266530014009366530016009506550020009667730030009868560006010168560196010229030013012180984961  a200808       200805                        eng     aEP31816627  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO15  aP2311aAn Assessment of China's Fertility Level Using the Variable-r Method10aCai, Yong  aU UT  aThe fertility level in China is a matter of uncertainty and controversy.

Although the importance of contextual influences for contraceptive behavior is well established in the literature, relatively little research has been conducted that explores how behavior is influenced by historical and contemporaneous contextual factors and by individual life experiences. In addition, much of this research has neglected the role of the normative environment within which contraceptive use takes place. The focus of this paper centers on the effect of contraceptive environment at both early and late stages of the life course and on how this effect is shaped by individual experience with migration to urban areas. This study takes advantage of a unique, prospective longitudinal data set with detailed information on community context at multiple points in time, an important improvement upon prior research. The results show that contraceptive behavior is particularly responsive to current community context, with past context primarily exerting an indirect effect on behavior through shaping current contextual influences. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aThailand  aContraceptive  a Migration  a Women  aJournal Article  g45g2h283-302tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0984962&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200802256naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450074001671000021002411100053002625201114003156500038014296500109014676510023015766530009015996530015016086530012016236530015016356530015016506550020016657730030016858560006017158560196017219030013019170984963  a200808       200805                        eng     aEP31816629  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aO1513aThe Gradient in Sub-Saharan Africa: Socioeconomic Status and HIV/AIDS10aFortson, Jane G.  aBecker Center on Chicago Price Theory, U Chicago  aUsing data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for Burkina Faso (2003), Cameroon (2004), Ghana (2003), Kenya (2003), and Tanzania (2003), I investigate the cross-sectional relationship between HIV status and socioeconomic status. I find evidence of a robust positive education gradient in HIV infection, showing that, up to very high levels of education, better-educated respondents are more likely to be HIV-positive. Adults with six years of schooling are as much as three percentage points more likely to be infected with HIV than adults with no schooling. This gradient is not an artifact of age, sector of residence, or region of residence. With controls for sex, age, sector of residence, and region of residence, adults with six years of schooling are as much as 50% more likely to be infected with HIV than those with no schooling. Education is positively related to certain risk factors for HIV, including the likelihood of having premarital sex. Estimates of the wealth gradient in HIV, by contrast, vary substantially across countries and are sensitive to the choice of measure of wealth. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSub-Saharan Africa  aAIDS  a Education  a Health  a Infection  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g45g2h303-22tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0984963&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200802605naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450062001671000028002291100009002575201330002666500050015966500038016466510010016846530011016946530014017056530013017196530027017326530024017596530015017836530017017986530019018156530020018346530015018546530021018696530015018906530013019056550020019187730030019388560006019688560196019749030013021700984964  a200808       200805                        eng     aEP31816630  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aE32  aI1210aMacroeconomic Fluctuations and Mortality in Postwar Japan10aTapia Granados, Jose A.  aU MI  aRecent research has shown that after long-term declining trends are excluded, mortality rates in industrial countries tend to rise in economic expansions and fall in economic recessions. In the present work, co-movements between economic fluctuations and mortality changes in postwar Japan are investigated by analyzing time series of mortality rates and eight economic indicators. To eliminate spurious associations attributable to trends, series are detrended either via Hodrick-Prescott filtering or through differencing. As previously found in other industrial economies, general mortality and age-specific death rates in Japan tend to increase in expansions and drop in recessions, for both males and females. The effect, which is slightly stronger for males, is particularly noticeable in those aged 45-64. Deaths attributed to heart disease, pneumonia, accidents, liver disease, and senility--making up about 41% of total mortality--tend to fluctuate procyclically, increasing in expansions. Suicides, as well as deaths attributable to diabetes and hypertensive disease, make up about 4% of total mortality and fluctuate countercyclically, increasing in recessions. Deaths attributed to other causes, making up about half of total deaths, don't show a clearly defined relationship with the fluctuations of the economy. 4aBusiness Fluctuations; Cycles         b(E32) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aJapan  aDeaths  a Diabetes  a Disease  a Economic Fluctuations  a Economic Indicator  a Expansion  a Fluctuation  a Heart Disease  a Macroeconomics  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  a Recession  a Suicide  aJournal Article  g45g2h323-43tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0984964&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200802183naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450057001671000023002247000020002471100014002677100009002815201061002906500076013516500166014276510009015936530014016026550020016167730030016368560006016668560196016729030013018680984965  a200808       200805                        eng     aEP31816631  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aN3110aFertility in New York State in the Pre-Civil War Era10aHaines, Michael R.10aGuest, Avery M.  aColgate U  aU WA  aKnowledge is quite limited about the extent and social correlates of marital fertility decline for the United States in the early part of the nineteenth century. Manuscripts from the New York State census of 1865 indicate a very slow decline in marital fertility during the initial decades of the nineteenth century and more rapid decline as the Civil War approached. Little evidence of fertility control within marriage is found for the very oldest women in the sample, but analysis of parity progression ratios indicates that some control had emerged by the midpoint of the nineteenth century. Fertility decline was most evident in the urban, more economically developed areas, but our data also indicate that the limited availability of agricultural land may have affected the transition. While a marital fertility transition occurred in nineteenth-century New York, many couples in various geographic areas and social strata continued to have quite high levels of fertility, indicating difficulties that were probably faced in controlling reproduction. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31)  aU.S.  aFertility  aJournal Article  g45g2h345-61tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0984965&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200802798naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450110001831000031002931100009003245201300003336500077016336500166017106500163018766500090020396510009021296530011021386530018021496530016021676550020021837730030022038560006022338560196022399030013024350984966  a200808       200805                        eng     aEP31816632  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aN31  aN32  aQ1210aPopulation Change and Farm Dependence: Temporal and Spatial Variation in the U.S. Great Plains, 1900-200010aWhite, Katherine J. Curtis  aU WI  aI investigate the relationship between county population change and farm dependence in the Great Plains region during the twentieth century, using spatial data analysis techniques. This research is rooted in a long-standing sociological and demographic interest in population responses to economic transitions and informs the theoretical understanding of urbanization processes. Using census and environmental data, the analysis challenges earlier assertions of a simple transition in the relationship between farm dependence and population change that accompanied modern technological advancements, namely tractors (the mechanization thesis). Rather than observing the proposed positive-to-negative shift, study results show a negative association throughout the pre- and post-mechanization periods. Partial support is found if the thesis is revised to consider the relationship between population change and the change in farm dependence rather than the level of farm dependence. Findings show mixed support for an alternative argument that nonfarm industries moderate the influence of farm dependence (the industry complex thesis). In contrast to earlier applications of the thesis, industrial relations in the Great Plains context are characterized by specialization rather than cooperation. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32) 4aMicro Analysis of Farm Firms, Farm Households, and Farm Input Markets         b(Q12)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Demographics  a Population  aJournal Article  g45g2h363-86tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0984966&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200802336naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450098001671000015002651100014002805201089002946500038013836500163014216510009015846530011015936530012016046530013016166530012016296530019016416530015016606530021016756530012016966550020017087730031017288560006017598560196017659030013019610984967  a200808       200805                        eng     aEP31816633  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aN3210aTrends in U.S. Adult Chronic Disease Mortality, 1960-1999: Age, Period, and Cohort Variations10aYang, Yang  aU Chicago  aIn this paper, I examine temporal changes in U.S. adult mortality by chronic disease cause of death and by sex over a 40-year period in the second half of the twentieth century. I apply age-period-cohort (APC) analyses that combine conventional approaches and a new method of model estimation to simultaneously account for age, period, and cohort variations in mortality rates for four leading causes of deaths, including heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and breast cancer. The results show that large reductions in mortality since the late 1960s continued well into the late 1990s and that these reductions were predominately contributed by cohort effects. Cohort effects are found to differ by specific causes of death examined, but they generally show substantial survival improvements. Implications of these results are discussed with regard to demographic theories of mortality reductions, differential cohort accumulation of health capital and lifetime exposures to socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors, and period changes in diagnostic techniques and medical treatment. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32)  aU.S.  aCancer  a Deaths  a Disease  a Health  a Heart Disease  a Mortality  a Mortality Rates  a Stroke  aJournal Article  g45g2h387-416tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0984967&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200802398naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450054001831000021002371100071002585200984003296500038013136500084013516500066014356500109015016510011016106530009016216530013016306530014016436530013016576530014016706530016016846530012017006530011017126550020017237730030017438560006017738560196017799030013019750984968  a200808       200805                        eng     aEP31816634  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ12  aJ16  aO1510aMarital Strategies for Regulating Exposure to HIV10aReniers, Georges  aInstitute of Behavioral Science, U CO, Boulder and U Witwatersrand  aIn a setting where the transmission of HIV occurs primarily through heterosexual contact and where no cure or vaccine is available, behavioral change is imperative for containing the epidemic. Abstinence, faithfulness, and condom use most often receive attention in this regard. In contrast, this article treats marriage as a resource for HIV risk management via mechanisms of positive selection (partner choice) and negative selection (divorce of an adulterous spouse). Retrospective marriage histories and panel data provide the evidence for this study, and results indicate that men and women in Malawi increasingly turned to union-based risk-avoidance strategies during the period that the threat of HIV/AIDS materialized. Although both sexes strategize in a similar fashion, men are better equipped than women to deploy these strategies to their advantage. The article concludes with reflections on the long-term and population-level implications of these coping mechanisms. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMalawi  aAIDS  a Divorce  a Epidemic  a Marital  a Marriage  a Population  a Spouse  a Women  aJournal Article  g45g2h417-38tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0984968&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200802665naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450065001751000019002401100021002595201350002806500076016306500084017066500076017906510009018666530010018756530018018856530015019036530013019186530014019316530013019456530010019586530017019686530017019856550020020027730030020228560006020528560196020589030013022540984969  a200808       200805                        eng     aEP31816635  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD81  aJ12  aJ1310aRisk Preferences and the Timing of Marriage and Childbearing10aSchmidt, Lucie  aWilliams College  aThe existing literature on marriage and fertility decisions pays little attention to the roles played by risk preferences and uncertainty. However, given uncertainty regarding the availability of suitable marriage partners, the ability to contracept, and the ability to conceive, women's risk preferences might be expected to play an important role in marriage and fertility timing decisions. By using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), I find that measured risk preferences have a significant effect on the timing of both marriage and fertility. Highly risk-tolerant women are more likely to delay marriage, consistent with either a search model of marriage or a risk-pooling explanation. In addition, risk preferences affect fertility timing in a way that differs by marital status and education, and that varies over the life cycle. Greater tolerance for risk leads to earlier births at young ages, consistent with these women being less likely to contracept effectively. In addition, as the subgroup of college-educated, unmarried women nears the end of their fertile periods, highly risk-tolerant women are likely to delay childbearing relative to their more risk-averse counterparts and are therefore less likely to become mothers. These findings may have broader implications for both individual and societal well-being. 4aCriteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty         b(D81) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Childbearing  a Fertility  a Marital  a Marriage  a Mothers  a Risk  a Risk Averse  a Uncertainty  aJournal Article  g45g2h439-60tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0984969&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200802462naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450098001671000023002657000023002887000024003111100015003357100016003507100015003665201212003816500084015936500076016776510009017536530010017626530011017726530014017836530014017976530012018116550020018237730030018438560006018738560196018799030013020750984970  a200808       200805                        eng     aEP31816636  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aCoparenting and Nonresident Fathers' Involvement with Young Children after a Nonmarital Birth10aCarlson, Marcia J.10aMcLanahan, Sara S.20aBrooks-Gunn, Jeanne  aColumbia U  aPrinceton U  aColumbia U  aWe use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to investigate the association between coparenting quality and nonresident fathers' involvement with children over the first five years after a nonmarital birth. We find that about one year after a nonmarital birth, 48% of fathers are living away from their child, rising to 56% and then to 63% at three and five years, respectively. Using structural equation models to estimate cross-lagged effects, we find that positive coparenting is a strong predictor of nonresident fathers' future involvement, whereas fathers' involvement is only a weak (but significant) predictor of future coparenting quality. The positive effect of coparenting quality on fathers' involvement is robust across several techniques designed to address unobserved heterogeneity and across different strategies for handling missing data. We conclude that parents' ability to work together in rearing their common child across households helps keep nonresident fathers connected to their children and that programs aimed at improving parents' ability to communicate may have benefits for children irrespective of whether the parents' romantic relationship remains intact. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Child  a Children  a Families  a Parent  aJournal Article  g45g2h461-88tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0984970&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200800541naa  2200157   4500001001100000008004400011022001300055245003200068100002100100710002100121655001400142773001000156856000600166856019900172903001200371EP28627032       200802                        eng     a0070337011aA NOTE FROM THE NEW EDITOR.10aLand, Kenneth C.  aDuke University.  aEditorial  g45g1  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=EP28627032&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFeb200802434naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450089001751000023002647000021002871100014003087100008003225201075003306500113014056500102015186500172016206510009017926530015018016530012018166550020018287730028018488560006018768560196018829030018020780961617  a200804       200802                        eng     aEP28627033  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aR21  aR2310aNeighborhood Selection and the Social Reproduction of Concentrated Racial Inequality10aSampson, Robert J.10aSharkey, Patrick  aHarvard U  aNYU  aIn this paper, we consider neighborhood selection as a social process central to the reproduction of racial inequality in neighborhood attainment. We formulate a multilevel model that decomposes multiple sources of stability and change in longitudinal trajectories of achieved neighborhood income among nearly 4,000 Chicago families followed for up to seven years wherever they moved in the United States. Even after we adjust for a comprehensive set of fixed and time-varying covariates, racial inequality in neighborhood attainment is replicated by movers and stayers alike. We also study the emergent consequences of mobility pathways for neighborhood-level structure. The temporal sorting by individuals of different racial and ethnic groups combines to yield a structural pattern of flows between neighborhoods that generates virtually nonoverlapping income distributions and little exchange between minority and white areas. Selection and racially shaped hierarchies are thus mutually constituted and account for an apparent equilibrium of neighborhood inequality. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand         b(R21) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aInequality  a Racial  aJournal Article  g45g1h1-29tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0961617&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200802601naa  2200469   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450106001911000023002977000022003207000022003421100026003647100015003907100015004055200914004206500042013346500076013766500066014526500053015186500172015716510009017436530015017526530014017676530019017816530013018006530019018136530019018326530011018516550020018627730029018828560006019118560196019179030018021130961618  a200804       200802                        eng     aEP28627034  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ13  aJ16  aJ22  aR2310aMaternal Work Hours and Adolescents' School Outcomes among Low-Income Families in Four Urban Counties10aGennetian, Lisa A.10aLopoo, Leonard M.10aLondon, Andrew S.  aBrookings Institution  aSyracuse U  aSyracuse U  aWe examine how changes in maternal work hours affect adolescent children's school participation and performance outcomes using data from interviews in 1998 and 2001 with approximately 1,700 women who, in May 1995, were welfare-reliant, single mothers of adolescents living in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty in Cuyahoga (Cleveland), Los Angeles, Miami-Dade, and Philadelphia counties. Analyses control for a broad array of mothers' characteristics, including their psychological and physical health, experiences with domestic violence and substance abuse, as well as unobserved time-invariant characteristics. In fixed-effects models, we find unfavorable effects of increased maternal work hours on three of six outcomes: skipping school, performing above average, and parental contact about behavior problems. Adolescent-aged sons seem to be particularly sensitive to changes in mothers' hours of work. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aAdolescent  a Children  a Hours of Work  a Mothers  a Participation  a Single Mother  a Women  aJournal Article  g45g1h31-53tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0961618&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4S7CWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200802686naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450072001751000019002471100009002665201396002756500113016716500064017846500172018486510009020206530010020296530018020396530010020576530012020676550020020797730029020998560006021288560196021349030018023300961619  a200804       200802                        eng     aEP28627035  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aK42  aR2313aThe Neighborhood Context of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Arrest10aKirk, David S.  aU MD  aThis study assesses the role of social context in explaining racial and ethnic disparities in arrest, with a focus on how distinct neighborhood contexts in which different racial and ethnic groups reside explain variations in criminal outcomes. To do so, I utilize a multilevel, longitudinal research design, combining individual-level data with contextual data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN). Findings reveal that black youths face multiple layers of disadvantage relative to other racial and ethnic groups, and these layers work to create differences in arrest. At the family level, results show that disadvantages in the form of unstable family structures explain much of the disparities in arrest across race and ethnicity. At the neighborhood level, black youths tend to reside in areas with both significantly higher levels of concentrated poverty than other youths as well as lower levels of collective efficacy than white youths. Variations in neighborhood tolerance of deviance across groups explain little of the arrest disparities, yet tolerance of deviance does influence the frequency with which a crime ultimately ends in an arrest. Even after accounting for relevant demographic, family, and neighborhood-level predictors, substantial residual arrest differences remain between black youths and youths of other racial and ethnic groups. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aIllegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law         b(K42) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aCrime  a Demographics  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g45g1h55-77tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0961619&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200802916naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450076001831000018002597000024002771100009003017100009003105201360003196500077016796500113017566500102018696500172019716510009021436530018021526530015021706530010021856530012021956530017022076530013022246550020022377730029022578560006022868560196022929030018024880961620  a200804       200802                        eng     aEP28627036  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ15  aR21  aR2310aImmigrant Residential Segregation in U.S. Metropolitan Areas, 1990-200010aIceland, John10aScopilliti, Melissa  aU MD  aU MD  aThis paper examines the extent of spatial assimilation among immigrants of different racial and ethnic origins. We use restricted data from the 1990 and 2000 censuses to calculate the levels of dissimilarity by race and Hispanic origin, nativity, and year of entry, and then run multivariate models to examine these relationships. The findings provide broad support for spatial assimilation theory. Foreign-born Hispanics, Asians, and blacks are more segregated from native-born non-Hispanic whites than are the U.S.-born of these groups. The patterns for Hispanics and Asians can be explained by the average characteristics of the foreign-born that are generally associated with higher levels of segregation, such as lower levels of income, English language ability, and homeownership. We also find that immigrants who have been in the United States for longer periods are generally less segregated than new arrivals, and once again, much of this difference can be attributed to the characteristics of immigrants. However, patterns also vary across groups. Levels of segregation are much higher for black immigrants than for Asian, Hispanic, and white immigrants. In addition, because black immigrants are, on average, of higher socioeconomic status than native-born blacks, such characteristics do not help explain their very high levels of segregation. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand         b(R21) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aHomeownership  a Immigrant  a Race  a Racial  a Residential  a Spatial  aJournal Article  g45g1h79-94tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0961620&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200802414naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450109001671000019002761100026002955201383003216500053017046500038017576510009017956530011018046530015018156530012018306550020018427730030018628560006018928560196018989030018020940961621  a200804       200802                        eng     aEP28627037  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aC83  aI1210aUsing Subjective Expectations to Forecast Longevity: Do Survey Respondents Know Something We Don't Know?10aPerozek, Maria  aFederal Reserve Board  aOld-age mortality is notoriously difficult to predict because it requires not only an understanding of the process of senescence--which is influenced by genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors--but also a prediction of how these factors will evolve. In this paper, I argue that individuals are uniquely qualified to predict their own mortality based on their own genetic background, as well as environmental and behavioral risk factors that are often known only to the individual. Given this private information, individuals form expectations about survival probabilities that may provide additional information to demographers and policymakers in their challenge to predict mortality. From expectations data from the 1992 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), I construct subjective, cohort life tables that are shown to predict the unusual direction of revisions to U.S. life expectancy by gender between 1992 and 2004: that is, for these cohorts, the Social Security Actuary (SSA) raised male life expectancy in 2004 and at the same lowered female life expectancy, narrowing the gender gap in longevity by 25% over this period. Further, although the subjective life expectancies for men appear to be roughly in line with the 2004 life tables, the subjective expectations of women suggest that female life expectancies estimated by the SSA might still be on the high side. 4aSurvey Methods; Sampling Methods         b(C83) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aHealth  a Mortality  a Survey  aJournal Article  g45g1h95-113tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0961621&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200802190naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450098001671000022002657000018002871100059003057100059003645201032004236500038014556500077014936510009015706530011015796530016015906550020016067730030016268560006016568560196016629030018018580961622  a200804       200802                        eng     aEP28627038  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1110aRetrospective Information on Health Status and Its Application for Population Health Measures10aMolla, Michael T.10aLubitz, James  aNational Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, MD  aNational Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, MD  aHealthy life expectancies are almost always calculated by using health data from cross-sectional surveys. This type of calculation is done partly because data from longitudinal surveys are not always available, and when they are available, they are collected at intervals that are longer than one year. In such cases, collecting health information retrospectively for the years skipped by the survey is useful. The main purpose of this paper is to show how retrospective health information can be used to estimate life expectancies in different health states. Healthy life expectancies are estimated with and without using data on retrospective health information, and the corresponding estimates are compared. The two sets of estimates are similar. We conclude that retrospectively assessed health information based on a one-year recall period can be used to estimate years of life in various health states and that estimates based on such information will closely approximate estimates based on concurrent health information. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aHealth  a Population  aJournal Article  g45g1h115-28tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0961622&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200801780naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450054001671000022002217000022002431100015002657100011002805200680002916500107009716500084010786510009011626530013011716530012011846550020011967730030012168560006012468560196012529030018014480961623  a200804       200802                        eng     aEP28627039  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aC81  aJ1213aThe Quality of Retrospective Data on Cohabitation10aHayford, Sarah R.10aMorgan, S.

We use event-history analysis to analyze rates of entry into cohabitation in age-period-cohort segments captured by multiple surveys. We find consistent discrepancies among the four surveys. The pattern of differences suggests that cohabitation histories underestimate cohabitation rates in distant periods relative to rates estimated closer to the date of survey. We conclude with cautions regarding the use of retrospective data on cohabitation. 4aMethodology for Collecting, Estimating, and Organizing Microeconomic Data; Data Access         b(C81) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aFamilies  a Family  aJournal Article  g45g1h129-41tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0961623&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200802390naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450106001671000024002737000028002971100009003257100009003345201177003436500107015206500113016276510009017406530020017496530015017696530010017846550020017947730030018148560006018448560196018509030018020460961624  a200804       200802                        eng     aEP28627040  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aC81  aJ1511aA Practical Approach to Using Multiple-Race Response Data: A Bridging Method for Public-Use Microdata10aLiebler, Carolyn A.20aHalpern-Manners, Andrew  aU MN  aU MN  aRevised federal policies require that multiple-race responses be allowed in all federal data collection efforts, but many researchers find the multitude of race categories and variables very difficult to use. Important comparability issues also interfere with using multiple-race data in analyses of multiple data sets and/or several points in time. These difficulties have, in effect, discouraged the use of the new data on race. We present a practical method for incorporating multiple-race respondents into analyses that use public-use microdata. Our method is a modification of the regression method developed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which uses multiple-race respondents' specific combination of races, as well as other individual-level and contextual characteristics, to predict the respondents' preferred single race. In this paper we (1) apply the NCHS-generated regression coefficients to public-use microdata with limited geographic information; and (2) provide a downloadable computer program with which researchers can apply this practical and preferable method for including multiple-race respondents in a wide variety of analyses. 4aMethodology for Collecting, Estimating, and Organizing Microeconomic Data; Data Access         b(C81) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aData Collection  a Microdata  a Race  aJournal Article  g45g1h143-55tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0961624&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200802264naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450089001671000017002567000022002737000018002951100022003137100009003357100022003445201065003666500107014316500077015386510009016156530017016246530015016416550020016567730030016768560006017068560196017129030018019080961625  a200804       200802                        eng     aEP28627041  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aC81  aJ1113aThe Multistate Life Table Method: An Application to Contraceptive Switching Behavior10aKuo, Tzy-Mey10aSuchindran, C.

Data on such behaviors are often collected in surveys as censored event histories. The multistate life table (MSLT) can be used to properly describe, in a single analysis, these complex transitions among multiple states measured in such data, but MSLT is rarely applied in the demographic literature because practical guidance is lacking on how to compute MSLTs with such data. We provide methods for computing MSLT quantities using censored event-history data: namely, transition intensities and probabilities, "state occupancy" probabilities and standard errors, average time spent in specified states, and average number of visits to specified states. Applying these methods to contraceptive use, we find high levels of switching back and forth, particularly between barrier methods and non-use, resulting in high rates of unintended pregnancy. 4aMethodology for Collecting, Estimating, and Organizing Microeconomic Data; Data Access         b(C81) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Migration  aJournal Article  g45g1h157-71tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0961625&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200802633naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450065001751000023002407000025002631100044002887100014003325201303003466500056016496500084017056500076017896510029018656530010018946530014019046530018019186530016019366530012019526530013019646550020019777730030019978560006020278560196020339030018022290961626  a200804       200802                        eng     aEP28627042  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI32  aJ12  aJ1313aThe International Child Poverty Gap: Does Demography Matter?10aHeuveline, Patrick10aWeinshenker, Matthew  aCA Center for Population Research, UCLA  aFordham U  aAccording to the Luxembourg Income Study data, the U.S. child poverty rate is the second highest among 15 high-income nations. The present work reveals that 55% of all American children living in a household headed by a single female with no other adult present live in poverty--the highest rate for any of the five living arrangements in the 15 countries examined in this study. While previous analyses have focused on market forces and governmental redistribution across households, we question the contribution of demographic factors that place children in family structures with different poverty risks relative to other factors such as differential market opportunities and governmental benefits for adults caring for children in various living arrangements. Applying a classic demographic decomposition technique to the overall poverty gap, we find that the distributional effect of demographic behavior contributes little to the U.S. poverty gap with other nations (and none with respect to the United Kingdom). Overall differences in labor markets and welfare schemes best explain the U.S. child poverty gap, although for some countries, the gap is accentuated by the gradient of governmental transfers, and for most countries, by the gradient of market earnings across living arrangements. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.; Selected Countries  aChild  a Children  a Demographics  a Demography  a Family  a Welfare  aJournal Article  g45g1h173-91tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0961626&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200802974naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450060001671000020002271100008002475201936002556500076021916500066022676510009023336530010023426530011023526530015023636530011023786550020023897730031024098560006024408560196024469030018026420961627  a200804       200802                        eng     aEP28627043  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1610aCohort Estimates of Nonmarital Fertility for U.S. Women10aWu, Lawrence L.  aNYU  aHistorical trends in U.S. nonmarital fertility have been compiled almost exclusively from vital statistics on births. This paper complements this historical record by providing cohort estimates of nonmarital fertility for cohorts of U.S. women spanning approximately 50 years of cohort experience. Life table estimates using retrospective marital and fertility histories in the June 1980, 1985, 1990, and 1995 Current Population Surveys reveal non-negligible levels of nonmarital fertility historically. For women born between 1925 and 1929, nearly 1 in 10 had at least one nonmarital birth by age 30. For women born between 1965 and 1969, more than 1 of 4 had one or more nonmarital births by age 30, with roughly 1 of 5 white, 3 of 5 black, and 1 in 3 Hispanic women having at least one nonmarital birth by age 30. Life table estimates reveal a twofold increase between ages 20 and 30 in the percentage of women with at least one child outside of formal marriage for all cohorts of white and Hispanic women, and an increase of roughly two-thirds for all cohorts of black women. I also document qualitative differences in nonmarital fertility by race/ethnicity, with the percentage of nonmarital births following a divorce or marital separation for white women approximately twice that for black or Hispanic women. Finally, I introduce a new measure, the cohort nonmarital fertility ratio (CNMFR), which provides a cohort complement to the standard period nonmarital fertility ratio. Conservative estimates reveal a roughly threefold increase in the CNMFR for women born from 1925-1929 to 1950-1954 for both whites and blacks, despite substantially higher levels of nonmarital fertility among black women. Overall, these findings reveal surprisingly high levels of nonmarital fertility for women born since the 1920s and confirm that nonmarital fertility has become an increasingly substantial component of overall U.S. fertility. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Child  a Fertility  a Women  aJournal Article  g45g1h193-207tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0961627&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200801803naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450033001591000019001927000015002117000018002267000018002447000021002621100017002837100059003007100009003597100015003687100016003835200677003996500084010766510012011606530011011726550020011837730030012038560006012338560196012399030018014350961628  a200804       200802                        eng     aEP28627044  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aMoving and Union Dissolution10aBoyle, Paul J.10aKulu, Hill10aCooke, Thomas10aGayle, Vernon10aMulder, Clara H.  aU St Andrews  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock  aU CT  aU Stirling  aU Amsterdam  aThis paper examines the effect of migration and residential mobility on union dissolution among married and cohabiting couples.

Even so, no study to date has examined the possible impact of within-nation geographical mobility on union dissolution. We base our longitudinal analysis on retrospective event-history data from Austria. Our results show that couples who move frequently have a significantly higher risk of union dissolution, and we suggest a variety of mechanisms that may explain this. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aAustria  aFamily  aJournal Article  g45g1h209-22tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0961628&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200802368naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450107001751000016002827000018002987000012003161100015003287100024003437100015003675200874003826500076012566500109013326500123014416510010015646530010015746530011015846530014015956530026016096530015016356530010016506530016016606550020016767730030016968560006017268560196017329030018019280961629  a200804       200802                        eng     aEP28627045  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO15  aP2313aThe Quantity-Quality Trade-Off of Children in a Developing Country: Identification Using Chinese Twins10aLi, Hongbin10aZhang, Junsen10aZhu, Yi  aTsinghua U  aChinese U Hong Kong  aMI State U  aTesting the trade-off between child quantity and quality within a family is complicated by the endogeneity of family size. Using data from the Chinese Population Census, we examine the effect of family size on child educational attainment in China. We find a negative correlation between family size and child outcome, even after we control for the birth order effect. We then instrument family size by the exogenous variation that is induced by a twin birth and find a negative effect of family size on children's education. We also find that the effect of family size is more evident in rural China, where the public education system is poor. Given that our estimates of the effect of having twins on nontwins at least provide the lower bound of the true effect of family size, these findings suggest a quantity-quality trade-off for children in developing countries. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population         b(P23)  aChina  aBirth  a Child  a Children  a Developing Countries  a Education  a Poor  a Population  aJournal Article  g45g1h223-43tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0961629&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200802243naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450030001751000022002051100009002275201049002366500052012856500109013376500172014466510013016186530011016316530016016426550020016587730031016788560006017098560196017159030018019110952376  a200802       200711                        eng     aEP27231579  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI11  aO15  aR2310aPutting People into Place10aEntwisle, Barbara  aU NC  aOver the past two decades, there has been an explosion of empirical research on neighborhoods and health. However, although the data and approaches owe much to the early contributions of demographers and population scientists, this debt is largely unrecognized. Likewise, challenges posed in the early literature remain largely unanswered. I argue that just as demographers and population scientists were pioneers in the study of neighborhoods and health, they are uniquely poised to lead the field again. Putting people into place means explaining behavior and outcomes in relation to a potentially changing local context. A more dynamic conceptualization is needed that fully incorporates human agency, integrates multiple dimensions of local social and spatial context, develops the necessary longitudinal data, and implements appropriate tools. Diverse approaches with complementary strengths will help surmount the many analytic challenges to studying the dynamics of neighborhoods and health, including agent-based microsimulation models. 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aThailand  aHealth  a Population  aJournal Article  g44g4h687-703tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0952376&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200701995naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450034001671000023002017000028002241100014002527100013002665200968002796500076012476500066013236510024013896530010014136550020014237730030014438560006014738560196014799030018016750952377  a200802       200711                        eng     aEP27231580  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1613aThe Seasonality of Conception10aRizzi, Ester Lucia20aDalla-Zuanna, Gianpiero  aU Messina  aU Padova  aIndividual data on menstrual cycles of noncontracepting women living in Western countries were used in order to verify whether the biological seasonality of conception persists after sexual behavior is controlled for. Episodes of intercourse were recorded daily, and the time of ovulation was detected by a marker. We find that the seasonality of conception changes with woman's age and frequency of episodes of sexual intercourse. In particular, for women aged 27-31 having only one act of intercourse during the six most fertile days of the menstrual cycle, the seasonality of fecundability is stronger. In this age group in the Northern Hemisphere, if seasonality of acts of sexual intercourse is controlled, the monthly distribution of probability of conception is bimodal, with two maxima (September and January) and two minima (December and March). When unobserved characteristics of the couples are considered, this seasonal pattern of conception persists. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aEurope; New Zealand  aWomen  aJournal Article  g44g4h705-28tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0952377&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200702687naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450041001671000024002087000023002321100015002557100034002705201466003046500076017706500109018466510055019556530017020106530021020276530015020486530016020636550020020797730030020998560006021298560196021359030018023310952378  a200802       200711                        eng     aEP27231581  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO1513aThe Estimation of Unwanted Fertility10aCasterline, John B.20aEl-Zeini, Laila O.  aOH State U  aCairo U and American U, Cairo  aThe estimation of unwanted fertility is a major objective of demographic surveys, including DHS surveys conducted in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Levels and trends in unwanted fertility are important input to the formulation of population policy and the evaluation of family planning programs. Yet existing methods for estimating unwanted fertility are known to be defective, among other reasons because they rely on subjective data whose validity and reliability are questionable. In this article, we propose a new estimator of unwanted fertility--the "aggregate prospective estimator"--so-named because it depends on the stated preference for another child at the time of the survey, the fertility-desires item consistently shown to possess the highest validity and reliability. Under reasonable assumptions, the aggregate prospective estimator produces less biased estimates of unwanted fertility than the most widely used existing methods. The new estimator has the limitation of generating only aggregate-level estimates, but such estimates are the primary data for policy formulation and program evaluation. The new estimator is presented in this article, along with an evaluation of its underlying assumptions and its sensitivity to several sources of error. In an illustrative application to recent DHS data from six countries, the new estimator yields substantially higher estimates of unwanted fertility than existing methods in all six countries. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBangladesh; Egypt; Ghana; Kenya; Peru; Philippines  aDemographics  a Family Planning  a Fertility  a Population  aJournal Article  g44g4h729-45tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0952378&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200702784naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450059001831000027002427000022002697000023002911100009003147100040003237100040003635201356004036500052017596500073018116500076018846500109019606510010020696530010020796530015020896530012021046550020021167730030021368560006021668560196021729030018023680952379  a200802       200711                        eng     aEP27231582  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI11  aI18  aJ13  aO1513aThe Spread of Health Services and Fertility Transition20aBrauner-Otto, Sarah R.10aAxinn, William G.10aGhimire, Dirgha J.  aU NC  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aWe use detailed measures of social change over time, increased availability of various health services, and couples' fertility behaviors to document the independent effects of health services on fertility limitation. Our investigation focuses on a setting in rural Nepal that experienced a transition from virtually no use of birth control in 1945 to the widespread use of birth control by 1995 to limit fertility. Changes in the availability of many different dimensions of health services provide the means to evaluate their independent influences on contraceptive use to limit childbearing. Findings show that family planning as well as maternal and child health services have independent effects on the rate of ending childbearing. For example, the provision of child immunization services increases the rate of contraceptive use to limit fertility independently of family planning services. Additionally, new Geographic Information System (GIS)-based measures also allow us to test many alternative models of the spatial distribution of services. These tests reveal that complex, geographically defined measures of all health service providers outperform more simple measures. These results provide new information about the consequences of maternal and child health services and the importance of these services in shaping fertility transitions. 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aNepal  aBirth  a Fertility  a Health  aJournal Article  g44g4h747-70tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0952379&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200702759naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450085001751000024002607000023002847000023003071100019003307100033003497100015003825201316003976500038017136500076017516500109018276510015019366530010019516530011019616530015019726530012019876530015019996530013020146530015020276530013020426550020020557730030020758560006021058560196021119030018023070952380  a200802       200711                        eng     aEP27231583  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aO1513aThe Impact of Childhood Mortality on Fertility in Six Rural Thanas of Bangladesh10aHossain, Mian Bazle10aPhillips, James F.10aLegrand, Thomas K.  aMorgan State U  aPopulation Council, New York  aU Montreal  aIn this article, we examine the relationship between child mortality and subsequent fertility using prospective longitudinal data on births and childhood deaths occurring to nearly 8,000 Bangladeshi mothers observed over the 1982-1993 period, a time of rapid fertility decline. Generalized hazard-regression analyses are employed to assess the effect of infant and child mortality on the hazard of conception, with controls for birth order and maternal age and educational attainment. Results show that childhood mortality reduces the time to subsequent conception if the death occurs within a given interval, representing the combined effect of biological and volitional replacement. The time to conception is also reduced if a childhood death occurs during a prior birth interval, a finding that signifies an effect of volitional replacement of the child that died. Moreover, mortality effects in prior birth intervals are consistent with hypothesized insurance (or hoarding) effects. Interaction of replacement with elapsed time suggests that the volitional impact of child mortality increases as the demographic transition progresses. This volitional effect interacts with sex of index child. Investigation of higher-order interactions suggests that this gender-replacement effect has not changed over time. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBangladesh  aBirth  a Child  a Childhood  a Deaths  a Fertility  a Infants  a Mortality  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g44g4h771-84tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0952380&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLWWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200702733naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450134001831000018003177000018003357000022003531100036003757100011004117100067004225201156004896500038016456500084016836500066017676500160018336510033019936530011020266530015020376530012020526550020020647730031020848560006021158560196021219030018023170952381  a200802       200711                        eng     aEP27231584  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ12  aJ16  aN3310aWidowhood, Family Size, and Post-Reproductive Mortality: A Comparative Analysis of Three Populations in Nineteenth-Century Europe10aAlter, George10aDribe, Martin10avan Poppel, Frans  aPopulation Studies Center, U MI  aLund U  aNetherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute, The Hague  aResearchers from a number of disciplines have offered competing theories about the effects of childbearing on parents' postreproductive longevity. The "disposable soma theory" argues that investments in somatic maintenance increase longevity but reduce childbearing. "Maternal depletion" models suggest that the rigors of childrearing increase mortality in later years. Other researchers consider continued childbearing a sign of healthy aging and a predictor of future longevity. Empirical studies have produced inconsistent and contradictory results. Our focus is on the experience of widowhood, which has been ignored in previous studies. We hypothesize that the death of a spouse is a stressful event with long-term consequences for health, especially for women with small children. Data are drawn from historical sources in Sweden, Belgium, and the Netherlands from 1766 to 1980. Postreproductive mortality was highest among young widows with larger families in all three samples. Age at last birth had little or no effect. We conclude that raising children under adverse circumstances can have long-lasting, harmful effects on a mother's health. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Europe: Pre-1913         b(N33)  aBelgium; Netherlands; Sweden  aFamily  a Mortality  a Parent  aJournal Article  g44g4h785-806tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0952381&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200702406naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450042001751000019002177000022002367000022002581100015002807100015002957100015003105201143003256500084014686500076015526500066016286510009016946530010017036530012017136530014017256530011017396550020017507730030017708560006018008560196018069030018020020952382  a200802       200711                        eng     aEP27231585  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ13  aJ1610aFamily Transitions in Young Adulthood10aSchoen, Robert10aLandale, Nancy S.10aDaniels, Kimberly  aPA State U  aPA State U  aPA State U  aUsing the first (1995) and third (2001-2002) waves of the Add Health survey, we examine women's family transitions up to age 24. Only a third of all women marry, and a fifth of those marriages dissolve before age 24. Three out of eight women have a first birth, with a substantial majority of those births outside of marriage: 66% for whites, 96% for blacks, and 72% for Mexican Americans. Cohabitation is the predominant union form; 59% of women cohabit at least once by age 24. Most cohabitations are short lived, with approximately one in five resulting in a marriage. We summarize the family and relationship experience of women up to age 24 in terms of four categories, each accounting for roughly a quarter of all women. Category 1 has the women who remain single nonparents. Category 2 has the early marriers, women whose marriage is not preceded by a first birth. Category 3 has those who become single parents. Category 4 has the women who cohabit at least once, but who do not marry or have a birth by age 24.

A one-percentage-point reduction in unemployment is predicted to raise CHD mortality by 0.75%, corresponding to almost 3,900 additional fatalities. The increase in relative risk is similar across age groups, implying that senior citizens account for most of the extra deaths. Direct evidence is obtained of a role for decreases in medical interventions treating coronary problems. CHD mortality increases rapidly when the economy strengthens but returns to or near its baseline level within five years for most groups. 4aBusiness Fluctuations; Cycles         b(E32) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Disease  a Heart Disease  a Macroeconomics  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g44g4h829-48tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0952384&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200702090naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450073001751000030002487000018002781100022002967100037003185200779003556500065011346500065011996500098012646510009013626530013013716530018013846530013014026530021014156530010014366550020014467730030014668560006014968560196015029030018016980952385  a200802       200711                        eng     aEP27231588  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ31  aJ61  aZ1310aSocial Networks and Their Impact on the Earnings of Mexican Migrants20aAmuedo-Dorantes, Catalina10aMundra, Kusum  aSan Diego State U  aKM Economic Consulting, La Jolla  aWe examine the impact of different types of social networks on the wages earned by unauthorized and legal Mexican migrants during their last U.S. trip. Familial ties raise unauthorized and legal migrants' hourly wages by an average of 2.6% and 8%, respectively, and friendship ties increase their wages by 5.4% and 3.6%, correspondingly. Furthermore, family ties seem to comparatively favor legal migrants in terms of earnings, raising their wages by approximately 0.9% more than for similar unauthorized migrants. These results underscore the potentially important role of social networks in raising Mexican migrants' earnings, particularly among unauthorized migrants. By increasing the returns to migration, social networks may provide a stimulus to continued emigration. 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aU.S.  aEarnings  a Hourly Wages  a Migrant  a Social Networks  a Wage  aJournal Article  g44g4h849-63tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0952385&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200702181naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450102001751000027002771100009003045201003003136500083013166500065013996500065014646510009015296530013015386530019015516530015015706550020015857730030016058560006016358560196016419030018018370952386  a200802       200711                        eng     aEP27231589  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ24  aJ31  aJ6110aU.S. Immigrants' Labor Market Adjustment: Additional Human Capital Investment and Earnings Growth10aAkresh, Ilana Redstone  aU IL  aNew Immigrant Survey-Pilot data are used to address the long-standing debate over whether immigrants to the United States assimilate economically. Using panel data and an individual fixed-effect specification, I find evidence indicating rapid economic assimilation, on the order of an average increase in earnings of 12%-13% during the 12-month survey period. Results indicate partial support for Duleep and Regets' Immigrant Human Capital Investment (IHCI) model, indicating an inverse relationship between initial earnings and earnings growth and showing some evidence of the expected interaction between skill transferability and skill level when predicting human capital investment decisions. Having more years of education, English proficiency, and lower earnings at the baseline are associated with a higher probability of enrolling in formal school in the United States. Overall, findings suggest substantial economic integration within the first year after establishing permanent residency. 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aEarnings  a Human Capital  a Immigrant  aJournal Article  g44g4h865-81tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0952386&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200701930naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450087001751000024002627000029002861100019003157100016003345200683003506500042010336500083010756500065011586510016012236530014012396530019012536530015012726530011012876550020012987730030013188560006013488560196013549030018015500952387  a200802       200711                        eng     aEP27231590  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ24  aJ6110aPostimmigration Investments in Education: A Study of Immigrants in the Netherlands10avan Tubergen, Frank10avan de Werfhorst, Herman  aICS, Utrecht U  aAmsterdam U  aWe use a unique data source to examine postimmigration investments in education among four immigrant groups in the Netherlands. We derive hypotheses from the Immigrant Human Capital Investment model (IHCI), which argues that immigrants' investments are an outcome of settlement intentions, skill transferability, and opportunity costs. The multinomial and ordered logistic regression analyses show that educational investments are stronger among immigrants with higher premigration education, immigrants from former colonies, immigrants who migrated for family reasons, and immigrants who arrived in periods of high unemployment. These findings generally support the IHCI model. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aNetherlands  aEducation  a Human Capital  a Immigrant  a Skill  aJournal Article  g44g4h883-98tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0952387&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200702535naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450131001591000022002907000021003127000023003331100019003567100013003757100009003885201511003976500034019086510009019426530011019516550020019627730031019828560006020138560196020199030018022150952388  a200802       200711                        eng     aEP27231591  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1910aWhat a Drop Can Do: Dried Blood Spots as a Minimally Invasive Method for Integrating Biomarkers into Population-Based Research10aMcDade, Thomas W.10aWilliams, Sharon10aSnodgrass, J. Josh  aNorthwestern U  aPurdue U  aU OR  aLogistical constraints associated with the collection and analysis of biological samples in community-based settings have been a significant impediment to integrative, multilevel biodemographic and biobehavioral research. However, recent methodological developments have overcome many of these constraints and have also expanded the options for incorporating biomarkers into population-based health research in international as well as domestic contexts. In particular, using dried blood spot (DBS) samples--drops of whole blood collected on filter paper from a simple finger prick--provides a minimally invasive method for collecting blood samples in nonclinical settings. After a brief discussion of biomarkers more generally, we review procedures for collecting, handling, and analyzing DBS samples. Advantages of using DBS samples--compared with venipuncture--include the relative ease and low cost of sample collection, transport, and storage. Disadvantages include requirements for assay development and validation as well as the relatively small volumes of sample. We present the results of a comprehensive literature review of published protocols for analysis of DBS samples, and we provide more detailed analysis of protocols for 45 analytes likely to be of particular relevance to population-level health research. Our objective is to provide investigators with the information they need to make informed decisions regarding the appropriateness of blood spot methods for their research interests. 4aHealth: Other         b(I19)  aU.S.  aHealth  aJournal Article  g44g4h899-925tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0952388&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200700464naa  2200133   4500001001100000008004400011022001300055245001300068655002200081773001000103856000600113856019900119903001200318EP25690103       200708                        eng     a0070337010aERRATUM.  aCorrection notice  g44g3  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=EP25690103&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAug200703309naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450101001751000022002767000022002987000024003207000023003447000023003671100009003907100009003997100009004087100043004177100009004605201820004696500038022896500076023276500113024036510009025166530011025256530013025366530021025496530015025706530010025856550020025957730030026158560006026458560196026519030016028470932390  a200710       200708                        eng     aEP25690104  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aJ1510aParadox Found (Again): Infant Mortality among the Mexican-Origin Population in the United States10aHummer, Robert A.10aPowers, Daniel A.10aPullum, Starling G.10aGossman, Ginger L.10aFrisbie, W. Parker  aU TX  aU TX  aU TX  aTX Department of State Health Services  aU TX  aRecent research suggests that the favorable mortality outcomes for the Mexican immigrant population in the United States may largely be attributable to selective out-migration among Mexican immigrants, resulting in artificially low recorded death rates for the Mexican-origin population. In this paper, we calculate detailed age-specific infant mortality rates by maternal race/ethnicity and nativity for two important reasons: (1) it is extremely unlikely that women of Mexican origin would migrate to Mexico with newborn babies, especially if the infants were only a few hours or a few days old; and (2) more than 50% of all infant deaths in the United States occur during the first week of life, when the chances of out-migration are very small. We use concatenated data from the U.S. linked birth and infant death cohort files from 1995 to 2000, which provides us with over 20 million births and more than 150,000 infant deaths to analyze. Our results clearly show that first-hour, first-day, and first-week mortality rates among infants born in the United States to Mexican immigrant women are about 10% lower than those experienced by infants of non-Hispanic, white U.S.-born women. It is extremely unlikely that such favorable rates are artificially caused by the out-migration of Mexican-origin women and infants, as we demonstrate with a simulation exercise. Further, infants born to U.S.-born Mexican American women exhibit rates of mortality that are statistically equal to those of non-Hispanic white women during the first weeks of life and fare considerably better than infants born to non-Hispanic black women, with whom they share similar socioeconomic profiles. These patterns are all consistent with the definition of the epidemiologic paradox as originally proposed by Markides and Coreil (1986). 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Infants  a Mortality Rates  a Mortality  a Race  aJournal Article  g44g3h441-57tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0932390&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200702562naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450063001671000023002307000023002537000021002767000025002971100035003227100009003577100062003667100035004285201287004636500038017506500108017886510009018966530015019056530012019206550020019327730030019528560006019828560196019889030016021840932391  a200710       200708                        eng     aEP25690105  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1410aChronic Conditions and the Decline in Late-Life Disability10aFreedman, Vicki A.10aSchoeni, Robert F.10aMartin, Linda G.10aCornman, Jennifer C.  aU Medicine and Dentistry of NJ  aU MI  aInstitute of Medicine, National Academies, Washington, DC  aU Medicine and Dentistry of NJ  aUsing data from the 1997-2004 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we examine the role of chronic conditions in recent declines in late-life disability prevalence. Building upon prior studies, we decompose disability declines into changes in the prevalence of chronic conditions and in the risk of disability given a condition. In doing so, we extend Kitigawa's (1955) classical decomposition technique to take advantage of the annual data points in the NHIS. Then we use respondents' reports of conditions causing their disability to repartition these traditional decomposition components. We find a general pattern of increasing prevalence of chronic conditions accompanied by declines in the percentage reporting disability among those with a given condition. We also find declines in heart and circulatory conditions, vision impairments, and possibly arthritis and increases in obesity as reported causes of disability. Based on decomposition analyses, we conclude that heart and circulatory conditions as well as vision limitations played a major role in recent declines in late-life disability prevalence and that arthritis may also be a contributing factor. We discuss these findings in light of improvements in treatments and changes in the environments of older adults. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aDisability  a Health  aJournal Article  g44g3h459-77tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0932391&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200702009naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450079001671000016002467000018002621100059002807100059003395200769003986500038011676500108012056510009013136530015013226530014013376530013013516530012013646530015013766550020013917730030014118560006014418560196014479030016016430932392  a200710       200708                        eng     aEP25690106  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1410aWas There Compression of Disability for Older Americans from 1992 to 2003?10aCai, Liming10aLubitz, James  aNational Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, MD  aNational Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, MD  aMedical advances and the growth of the elderly population have focused interest on trends in the health of the elderly. Three theories have been advanced to describe these trends: compression of morbidity, expansion of morbidity, and dynamic equilibrium. We applied multistate life table methods to the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey to estimate active and disabled life expectancy from 1992 to 2003, defining disability as having difficulty with instrumental activities of daily living or activities of daily living. We found increases in active life expectancy past age 65 and decreases in life expectancy with severe disability. These trends are consistent with elements of both the theory of compression of morbidity and the theory of dynamic equilibrium. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aDisability  a Disabled  a Elderly  a Health  a Morbidity  aJournal Article  g44g3h479-95tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0932392&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200703227naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450113001911000013003047000014003177000021003311100060003527100011004127100011004235201499004346500038019336500108019716500109020796500123021886500155023116510010024666530011024766530013024876530010025006530014025106550020025247730031025448560006025758560196025819030016027770932393  a200710       200708                        eng     aEP25690107  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ14  aO15  aP23  aP3613aThe Association of Childhood Socioeconomic Conditions with Healthy Longevity at the Oldest-Old Ages in China10aYi, Zeng10aGu, Danan10aLand, Kenneth C.  aDuke U and China Center for Economic Research, Peking U  aDuke U  aDuke U  aBased on unique data from the largest-ever sample of the Chinese oldest-old aged 80 and older, our multivariate logistic regression analyses show that either receiving adequate medical service during sickness in childhood or never/rarely suffering from serious illness during childhood significantly reduces the risk of being ADL (activities of daily living) impaired, being cognitively impaired, and self-reporting poor health by 18%-33% at the oldest-old ages. Estimates of effects for five other indicators of childhood conditions are similarly positive but mostly not statistically significant. Multivariate survival analysis shows that better childhood socioeconomic conditions in general tend to reduce the four-year period mortality risk among the oldest-old. But after additional controls for 14 covariates are put into the model, the effects are not statistically significant, thus suggesting that most of the effects of childhood conditions on oldest-old mortality are indirect--at least to the point of affecting current health status at the oldest-old ages, which itself is strongly associated with mortality. While acknowledging limitations of the present analyses due to a lack of information on childhood illness, the oldest-olds' recollection errors, and other data problems, we conclude, based on this and other studies, that policies that enhance childhood health care and children's socioeconomic well-being can have large and long-lasting benefits up to the oldest-old ages. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population         b(P23) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36)  aChina  aHealth  a Old Age  a Poor  a Sickness  aJournal Article  g44g3h497-518tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0932393&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200702473naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450113001671000021002801100011003015201395003126500038017076500084017456510011018296530011018406530012018516530013018636530015018766550020018917730030019118560006019418560196019479030016021430932394  a200710       200708                        eng     aEP25690108  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1211aA Fixed-Effects Multilevel Analysis of How Community Family Structure Affects Individual Mortality in Norway10aKravdal, Oystein  aU Oslo  aBy using register data for the entire Norwegian population aged 50-89 in the period 1980-1999, during which there were about 720,000 deaths, I estimate how the proportions of persons who were divorced or never married in the municipality affected all-cause mortality, net of individual marital status. The data include individual histories of changes in marital status and places of residence, providing a rare opportunity to enter municipality fixed effects into the model, thereby capturing the time-invariant unobserved factors at that level. The positive health externality of marriage that is suggested in the literature is supported by some of the estimates for women. Other estimates--especially those for men--point in the opposite direction. One possible interpretation of these findings is that social cohesion is perhaps not as beneficial for people's health as often claimed, at least not for both sexes. Alternatively, the results may reflect that marriage perhaps undermines rather than strengthens social cohesion, or that other mechanisms are involved--for example, those that are related to people's perceptions of their health relative to the health of others. Estimates from models without such municipality fixed effects are markedly different, but these also shed doubt on the notion that a high proportion of unmarried persons generally increases individual mortality. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aNorway  aDeaths  a Family  a Marital  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g44g3h519-37tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0932394&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200702860naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450069001751000025002441100020002695201603002896500113018926500041020056500172020466510009022186530009022276530017022366530013022536550020022667730030022868560006023168560196023229030016025180932395  a200710       200708                        eng     aEP25690109  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aJ71  aR2310aRace and the Spatial Segregation of Jobless Men in Urban America10aWagmiller, Robert L.  aU Buffalo, SUNY  aChanges in U.S. metropolitan areas over the past 30 years are thought to have concentrated jobless men in low-income, predominantly minority neighborhoods clustered near the center of the city. Using tract-level data from the Neighborhood Change Database for 1970-2000, I examine how the residential segregation of jobless from employed men has changed over the past three decades. I find that jobless men in U.S. metropolitan areas have become less uniformly distributed throughout the metropolis and more isolated, concentrated, and clustered since 1970; but they have also become less centralized. Racial and ethnic group differences in the spatial segregation of jobless men are large. Jobless black men occupy a uniquely disadvantaged ecological position in the metropolis: in comparison with other jobless men, they are much less uniformly distributed throughout the metropolis and much more isolated from employed men, they are concentrated in a smaller amount of physical space, and their neighborhoods are more clustered and are located closer to the center of the city. The dimensions of segregation strongly overlap for black jobless men, producing a multidimensional layering of segregation not encountered by other jobless men. Multivariate models reveal that the uniquely disadvantaged ecological position of jobless black men is less a reflection of different patterns of regional concentration and metropolitan settlement or of differences in group-status characteristics than it is an inevitable consequence of extreme levels of racial residential segregation in the United States. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aRace  a Segregation  a Spatial  aJournal Article  g44g3h539-62tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0932395&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200702974naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450077001751000023002527000021002757000026002967000024003221100014003467100015003607100047003757100047004225201488004696500113019576500041020706500172021116510009022836530011022926530017023036550020023207730030023408560006023708560196023769030016025720932396  a200710       200708                        eng     aEP25690110  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aJ71  aR2310aNational Estimates of Racial Segregation in Rural and Small-Town America10aLichter, Daniel T.10aParisi, Domenico10aGrice, Steven Michael10aTaquino, Michael C.  aCornell U  aMS State U  aSocial Science Research Center, MS State U  aSocial Science Research Center, MS State U  aThe objective of this paper is to provide, for the first time, comparative estimates of racial residential segregation of blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan places in 1990 and 2000. Analyses are based on block data from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. decennial censuses. The results reveal a singularly important and perhaps surprising central conclusion: levels and trends in recent patterns of racial segregation in America's small towns are remarkably similar to patterns observed in larger metropolitan cities. Like their big-city counterparts, nonmetropolitan blacks are America's most highly segregated racial minority--roughly 30% to 40% higher than the indices observed for Hispanics and Native Americans. Finally, baseline ecological models of spatial patterns of rural segregation reveal estimates that largely support the conclusions reached in previous metropolitan studies. Racial residential segregation in rural places increases with growing minority percentage shares and is typically lower in "new" places (as measured by growth in the housing stock), while racially selective annexation and the implied "racial threat" at the periphery exacerbate racial segregation in rural places. Our study reinforces the need to broaden the spatial scale of segregation beyond its traditional focus on metropolitan cities or suburban places, especially as America's population shifts down the urban hierarchy into exurban places and small towns. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aRacial  a Segregation  aJournal Article  g44g3h563-81tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0932396&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200702341naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450048001671000026002157000026002411100036002677100009003035201225003126500084015376500076016216510009016976530013017066530012017196530015017316550020017467730031017668560006017978560196018039030016019990932397  a200710       200708                        eng     aEP25690111  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aMultipartnered Fertility among American Men10aGuzzo, Karen Benjamin10aFurstenberg, Frank F.  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aU PA  aUsing the 2002 (Cycle 6) National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), which was the first NSFG to interview men, we document the prevalence and correlates of sequential parenthood with different partners (multipartnered fertility) among a representative sample of American men. Nearly 8% of American men aged 15-44 report having had children with more than one partner, with sharp differences by age, race/ethnicity, and income--over one-third of poor black men aged 35-44 report having had children with two or more mothers, and 16% report children with three or more mothers. Fathers of two or more children by multiple partners appear to be more disadvantaged than fathers with two or more children by the same partner. Multipartnered fertility is strongly related to prior birth characteristics; men not in a coresidential union at the preceding birth are more likely to have their next birth with a new partner, and controlling for prior-birth characteristics accounts for the elevated risk of Hispanics and blacks in baseline models. Results also suggest that multipartnered fertility is becoming more prevalent as younger cohorts transition to a new-partner birth more quickly and at a higher rate than older cohorts. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Family  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g44g3h583-601tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0932397&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200702411naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450125001671000022002927000018003147000021003321100033003537100033003867100033004195201141004526500038015936500076016316510009017076530015017166530019017316530019017506530012017696550020017817730030018018560006018318560196018379030016020330932398  a200710       200708                        eng     aEP25690112  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1310aContraceptive Use Patterns across Teens' Sexual Relationships: The Role of Relationships, Partners, and Sexual Histories10aManlove, Jennifer10aRyan, Suzanne10aFranzetta, Kerry  aChild Trends, Washington, DC  aChild Trends, Washington, DC  aChild Trends, Washington, DC  aBy using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examine how adolescent relationship characteristics, partner attributes, and sexual relationship histories are associated with contraceptive use and consistency, incorporating random effects to control for respondent-level unobserved heterogeneity. Analyses show that teens' contraceptive use patterns vary across relationships. Teens with more-monogamous partners, with more-intimate relationships, and who communicate about contraception before sex have greater odds of contraceptive use and/or consistency. Teens in romantic relationships, and who are older when engaging in sex for the first time, have greater odds of ever using contraceptives but reduced odds of always using contraceptives. Teens continue habits from previous relationships: teens with experience practicing contraceptive consistency and females who previously have used hormonal contraceptive methods are better able to maintain consistency in subsequent relationships. Also, relationship and partner characteristics are less important for females who previously used hormonal methods. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAdolescent  a Contraception  a Contraceptive  a Health  aJournal Article  g44g3h603-21tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0932398&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200702489naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450065001751000018002407000022002581100012002807100051002925201255003436500084015986500053016826500065017356510009018006530013018096530013018226530014018356530010018496550020018597730030018798560006019098560196019159030016021110932399  a200710       200708                        eng     aEP25690113  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ22  aJ3110aHow Do Marital Status, Work Effort, and Wage Rates Interact?10aAhituv, Avner10aLerman, Robert I.  aU Haifa  aAmerican U and Urban Institute, Washington, DC  aHow marital status interacts with men's earnings is an important analytic and policy issue, especially in the context of debates in the United States over programs that encourage healthy marriage. This paper generates new findings about the earnings-marriage relationship by estimating the linkages among flows into and out of marriage, work effort, and wage rates. The estimates are based on National Longitudinal Survey of Youth panel data, covering 23 years of marital and labor market outcomes, and control for unobserved heterogeneity. We estimate marriage effects on hours worked (our proxy for work effort) and on wage rates for all men and for black and low-skilled men separately. The estimates reveal that entering marriage raises hours worked quickly and substantially but that marriage's effect on wage rates takes place more slowly while men continue in marriage. Together, the stimulus to hours worked and wage rates generates an 18%* 19% increase in earnings, with about one-third to one-half of the marriage earnings premium attributable to higher work effort. At the same time, higher wage rates and hours worked encourage men to marry and to stay married. Thus, being married and having high earnings reinforce each other over time. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31)  aU.S.  aEarnings  a Marital  a Marriage  a Wage  aJournal Article  g44g3h623-47tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0932399&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200702809naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450118001751000017002937000023003101100015003337100015003485201582003636500083019456500065020286500065020936510017021586530013021756530015021886550020022037730030022238560006022538560196022599030016024550932400  a200710       200708                        eng     aEP25690114  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ24  aJ31  aJ6110aSelf-Selection and Earnings Assimilation: Immigrants from the Former Soviet Union in Israel and the United States10aCohen, Yinon10aHaberfeld, Yitchak  aTel Aviv U  aTel Aviv U  aDrawing on U.S. decennial census data and on Israeli census and longitudinal data, we compare the educational levels and earnings assimilation of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU) in the United States and Israel during 1968-2000. Because the doors to both countries were practically open to FSU immigrants between 1968 and 1989, when FSU immigrants were entitled to refugee visas in the United States, the comparison can be viewed as a natural experiment in immigrants' destination choices. The results suggest that FSU immigrants to the United States are of significantly higher educational level and experience significantly faster rates of earnings assimilation in their new destination than their counterparts who immigrated to Israel. We present evidence that patterns of self-selection in immigration to Israel and the United States--on both measured and unmeasured productivity-related traits--is the main reason for these results. When the immigration regulations in the United States changed in 1989, and FSU Jewish immigrants to the United States had to rely on family reunification for obtaining immigrant visas, the adverse effects of the policy change on the type of FSU immigrants coming to the United States were minor and short-lived. As early as 1992, the gaps in the educational levels between FSU immigrants coming to Israel and to the United States returned to their pre-1989 levels, and the differences in earnings assimilation of post-1989 immigrants in the United States and Israel are similar to the differences detected in the 1980s. 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aIsrael; U.S.  aEarnings  a Immigrant  aJournal Article  g44g3h649-68tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0932400&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200702575naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450122001671000023002891100035003125201556003476500038019036500063019416510009020046530016020136550020020297730030020498560006020798560196020859030016022810932401  a200710       200708                        eng     aEP25690115  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aQ5413aThe Political Ecology of Disaster: An Analysis of Factors Influencing U.S. Tornado Fatalities and Injuries, 1998-200010aDonner, William R.  aDisaster Research Center, U DE  aThis study examines casualties from tornadoes in the United States between the years 1998 and 2000. A political model of human ecology (POET) was used to explore how the environment, technology, and social inequality influence rates of fatalities and injuries in two models. Data were drawn from four sources: John Hart's Severe Plot v2.0, National Weather Service (NWS) Warning Verification data, Storm Prediction Center (SPC) watch data, and tract-level census data. Negative binomial regression was used to analyze the causes of tornado fatalities and injuries. Independent variables (following POET) are classified in the following manner: population, organization, environment, and technology. Rural population, population density, and household size correspond to population; racial minorities and deprivation represent social organization; tornado area represents environment; and tornado watches and warnings, as well as mobile homes, correspond to technology. Findings suggest a strong relationship between the size of a tornado path and both fatalities and injuries, whereas other measures related to technology, population, and organization produce significant yet mixed results. Census tracts having larger populations of rural residents was, of the nonenvironmental factors, the most conclusive regarding its effects across the two models. The outcomes of analysis, although not entirely supportive of the model presented in this study, suggest to some degree that demographic and social factors play a role in vulnerability to tornadoes. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aClimate; Natural Disasters; Global Warming         b(Q54)  aU.S.  aEnvironment  aJournal Article  g44g3h669-85tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0932401&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200701956naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450090001831000018002737000019002911100018003107100043003285200490003716500077008616500065009386500109010036500172011126510017012846530014013016530013013156550020013287730031013488560006013798560196013859030013015810922361  a200708       200705                        eng     aEP24895478  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ61  aO15  aR2310aUsing Age and Spatial Flow Structures in the Indirect Estimation of Migration Streams10aRaymer, James10aRogers, Andrei  aU Southampton  aInstitute of Behavioral Sciences, U CO  aThis article outlines a formal model-based approach for inferring interregional age-specific migration streams in settings where such data are incomplete, inadequate, or unavailable.

We focus on challenges associated with international immigration as an additional factor driving variation across groups. Using 2000 census data from Mexico and the United States, we compare the prevalence and age patterns of various types of extended family and non-kin living arrangements among Mexican-origin immigrants and nonimmigrants on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Additionally, we use the Survey of Income and Program Participation to examine the stability of extended family living arrangements among Mexican-origin immigrants and natives in the United States. We find that newly arrived immigrants to the United States display unique patterns in the composition and stability of their households relative to nonimmigrants in both Mexico and the United States. Recent immigrants are more likely to reside in an extended family or non-kin household, and among those living with relatives, recent immigrants are more likely to live with extended family from a similar generation (such as siblings and cousins). Further, these households experience high levels of turnover. The results suggest that the high levels of coresidence observed among recently arrived Mexican immigrants represent a departure from "traditional" household/family structures in Mexico and are related to the challenges associated with international migration. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMexico; U.S.  aCensus  a Demographics  a Family  a Immigrant  a Immigration  aJournal Article  g44g2h225-49tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922362&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200702211naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450105001671000021002727000021002937000021003141100040003357100040003757100040004155200892004556500108013476500113014556510009015686530015015776530016015926550020016087730030016288560006016588560196016649030013018600922363  a200708       200705                        eng     aEP24895480  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ14  aJ1513aThe Demography of Disability and the Effects of Immigrant History: Older Asians in the United States10aMutchler, Jan E.10aPrakash, Archana10aBurr, Jeffrey A.  aGerontology Institute, U MA, Boston  aGerontology Institute, U MA, Boston  aGerontology Institute, U MA, Boston  aUsing data from the 2000 U.S. census, we compare the older Asian population with U.S.-born, non-Hispanic whites with respect to three indicators of disability. Insofar as any Asian "advantage" in health vis-a-vis whites exists among the population aged 65 and over, our evidence suggests that it occurs primarily among the U.S.-born segments of this population. We also investigate how differences in disability levels among Asian immigrant groups are influenced by country of birth and by the combined effects of duration of residence in the United States and life cycle stage at entry. These results highlight the diversity of the older Asian population with respect to the ways in which immigration and origin history are linked to disability outcomes. We conclude that in later life, immigrant status confers few disability advantages among the Asian population in the United States. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aDemography  a Disability  aJournal Article  g44g2h251-63tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922363&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200702452naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001830430008001912450099001991000016002987000012003141100030003267100015003565200708003716500038010796500077011176500065011946500109012596500123013686500172014916510010016636530011016736530019016846530013017036530015017166530010017316550020017417730030017618560006017918560196017979030013019930922364  a200708       200705                        eng     aEP24895481  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ11  aJ61  aO15  aP23  aR2310aElderly Parent Health and the Migration Decisions of Adult Children: Evidence from Rural China10aGiles, John10aMu, Ren  aMI State U and World Bank  aWorld Bank  aRecent research has shown that participation in migrant labor markets has led to substantial increases in income for families in rural China. This article addresses the question of how participation is affected by elderly parent health. We find that younger adults are less likely to work as migrants when a parent is ill. Poor health of an elderly parent has less impact on the probability of employment as a migrant when an adult child has siblings who may be available to provide care. We also highlight the potential importance of including information on nonresident family members when studying how parent illness and elder care requirements influence the labor supply decisions of adult children. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population         b(P23) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aChina  aHealth  a Labor Markets  a Migrant  a Migration  a Poor  aJournal Article  g44g2h265-88tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922364&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200702709naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450081001751000020002567000021002767000024002977000018003211100056003397100046003957100040004417100061004815201262005426500038018046500042018426500108018846510011019926530014020036530013020176530015020306550020020457730031020658560006020968560196021029030013022980922365  a200708       200705                        eng     aEP24895482  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aI21  aJ1410aEducation of Adult Children and Mortality of Their Elderly Parents in Taiwan10aZimmer, Zachary10aMartin, Linda G.10aOfstedal, Mary Beth10aChuang, Yi-Li  aInstitute of Public and International Affairs, U UT  aInstitute of Medicine, National Academies  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aBureau of Health Promotion, Department of Health, Taiwan  aIn societies in which families are highly integrated, the education of family members may be linked to survival. Such may be the case in Taiwan, where there are large gaps in levels of education across generations and high levels of resource transfers between family members. This study employs 14 years of longitudinal data from Taiwan to examine the combined effects of the education of older adults and their adult children on the mortality outcomes of older adults. We use nested Gompertz hazard models to evaluate the importance of the education of an older adult and his or her highest-educated child after controlling for socioeconomic, demographic, and health characteristics at baseline. To gain further insight, we fit additional models based on the sample stratified by whether older adults report serious diseases at baseline. The results indicate that the educational levels of both older adults and children are associated with older adult mortality, but children's education appears more important when we examine the mortality of only those older adults who already report a serious disease. This finding suggests that there may be different roles for education in the onset versus the progression of a health problem that may lead to death. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aTaiwan  aEducation  a Elderly  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g44g2h289-305tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922365&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200701981naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450080001751000022002557000021002777000022002981100018003207100018003387100025003565200650003816500038010316500076010696500066011456510009012116530010012206530014012306530013012446530024012576530012012816530013012936550020013067730030013268560006013568560196013629030013015580922366  a200708       200705                        eng     aEP24895483  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aJ1613aThe Effects of Maternal Employment on Child Injuries and Infectious Disease10aGordon, Rachel A.10aKaestner, Robert10aKorenman, Sanders  aU IL, Chicago  aU IL, Chicago  aBaruch College, CUNY  aThis article presents estimates of effects of maternal paid work and nonmaternal child care on injuries and infectious disease for children aged 12 to 36 months.

Estimates indicate that maternal employment itself has no statistically significant adverse effects on the incidence of infectious disease and injury. However, greater time spent by children in center-based care is associated with increased rates of respiratory problems for children aged 12 to 36 months and increased rates of ear infections for children aged 12 to 24 months. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Disease  a Infectious Disease  a Injury  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g44g2h307-33tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922366&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200701939naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450107001751000018002827000017003007000018003171100022003357100022003577100013003795200729003926500038011216500042011596500076012016510011012776530010012886530014012986550020013127730030013328560006013628560196013689030013015640922367  a200708       200705                        eng     aEP24895484  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aI21  aJ1311aAs Low Birth Weight Babies Grow, Can Well-Educated Parents Buffer This Adverse Factor?

We find that LBW is negatively correlated with the probability of such children attending college at age 18; however, when both parents are college or high school graduates, such negative effects may be partially offset. We also show that discrimination against daughters occurs, but only for daughters who were LBW babies. Moreover, high parental education can buffer the LBW shock only among moderately LBW children (as compared with very LBW children) and full-term LBW children (as compared with preterm LBW children). 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aTaiwan  aBirth  a Children  aJournal Article  g44g2h335-43tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922367&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200701803naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450061001591000024002207000019002447000022002637000021002857000026003061100030003327100009003627100011003717100011003827100036003935200639004296500076010686510011011446530010011556530011011656550020011767730030011968560006012268560196012329030013014280922368  a200708       200705                        eng     aEP24895485  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aChild Care Availability and First-Birth Timing in Norway10aRindfuss, Ronald R.10aGuilkey, David10aMorgan, S.

I find evidence of endogenous social interactions (social multipliers), where the propensity of an individual choosing to have sex varies with the average behavior in his or her school. Additionally, the magnitude of the social multipliers and several other interesting risk factors differ by gender and by race. These findings might help explain the large variation in sexual initiation across schools in the United States. These results also add to the debate over school vouchers and ability grouping because social multipliers imply changes in school-wide rates of sexual behavior with moderate changes in school-body composition. In this way, school vouchers and ability grouping might exacerbate the situation of high rates of teenage pregnancy and out-of-wedlock births in some communities. To show the potential benefits and costs of public policies that cause students to change schools, I present the results of several simulation exercises that predict the school-level changes in rates of sexual initiation following changes in school composition. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g44g2h373-88tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922369&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200701740naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450074001671000018002411100017002595200723002766500084009996500066010836510009011496530012011586530014011706550020011847730031012048560006012358560196012419030013014370922370  a200708       200705                        eng     aEP24895487  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1610aRace, Military Service, and Marital Timing: Evidence from the NLSY-7910aTeachman, Jay  aWestern WA U  aI use data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Study of Youth to examine the relationship between military service and marital timing for white men and black men during the 1980s.

I find that active-duty military service increases the probability of first marriage for both whites and blacks. In part, this relationship is due to positive selectivity into the military and, for whites, to greater income and economic stability. Above and beyond the effects of selectivity, income, and economic stability, the effect of active-duty military service is particularly strong for black men. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aMarital  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g44g2h389-404tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922370&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200702597naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450071001831000023002547000017002771100045002947100054003395201177003936500038015706500077016086500076016856500109017616510013018706530017018836530015019006530015019156530016019306550020019467730030019668560006019968560196020029030013021980922371  a200708       200705                        eng     aEP24895488  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ11  aJ13  aO1513aThe Phoenix Population: Demographic Crisis and Rebound in Cambodia10aHeuveline, Patrick10aPoch, Bunnak  aPopulation Research Center and U Chicago  aCenter for Population Studies, Royal U Phnom Penh  aThe study of mortality crises provides an unusual and valuable perspective on the relationship between mortality and fertility changes, a relationship that has puzzled demographers for decades. In this article, we combine nationally representative survey and demographic-surveillance system data to study fertility trends around the time of the Khmer Rouge (KR) regime, under which 25% of the Cambodian population died. We present the first quantitative evidence to date that attests to a one-third decline of fertility during this regime, followed by a substantial "baby boom" after the fall of the KR. Further analyses reveal that the fertility rebound was produced not only by a two-year marriage bubble but also by a surge in marital fertility that remained for nearly a decade above its precrisis level. Our results illustrate the potential influence of mortality on fertility, which may be more difficult to identify for more gradual mortality declines. To the extent that until recently, Cambodian fertility appears to fit natural fertility patterns, our findings also reinforce recent qualifications about the meaning of this core paradigm of demographic analysis. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aCambodia  aDemographics  a Fertility  a Mortality  a Population  aJournal Article  g44g2h405-26tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922371&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200702007naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450086001671000022002531100021002755200915002966500084012116500172012956510009014676550020014767730030014968560006015268560196015329030013017280922372  a200708       200705                        eng     aEP24895489  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aR2310aStrength of Attachment: Survey Coverage of People with Tenuous Ties to Residences10aMartin, Elizabeth  aUS Census Bureau  aThis article draws on evidence from an exploratory survey of living situations to assess the validity of assumptions about residence and to offer methodological innovations to improve coverage of people with tenuous attachment to households. These innovations include more inclusive probes and questions used to compile the roster of household residents; a review of the places a person stayed the previous few months; and a Residential Attachment scale that measures strength of attachment to households. This scale shows that it takes more probing to list tenuously attached people than most surveys do, suggesting that tenuously attached people are likely to be omitted from the typical survey roster. The Residential Attachment scale is correlated with social and economic participation in households, suggesting that participation is fairly high even among those with tenuous or no residential attachment. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g44g2h427-40tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922372&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200702547naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450050001751000023002257000021002487000022002691100009002917100009003007100009003095201281003186500038015996500109016376500098017466510018018446530009018626530013018716530021018846550020019057730028019258560006019538560196019599030018021550922352  a200708       200702                        eng     aEP23779757  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aO15  aZ1310aSocial Networks and HIV/AIDS Risk Perceptions10aKohler, Hans-Peter10aBehrman, Jere R.10aWatkins, Susan C.  aU PA  aU PA  aU PA  aUnderstanding the determinants of individuals' perceptions of their risk of becoming infected with HIV and their perceptions of acceptable strategies of prevention is an essential step toward curtailing the spread of this disease. We focus in this article on learning and decision-making about AIDS in the context of high uncertainty about the disease and appropriate behavioral responses. We argue that social interactions are important for both. Using longitudinal survey data from rural Kenya and Malawi, we test this hypothesis. We investigate whether social interactions--and especially the extent to which social network partners perceive themselves to be at risk--exert causal influences on respondents' risk perceptions and on one approach to prevention, spousal communication about the threat of AIDS to the couple and their children. The study explicitly allows for the possibility that important characteristics, such as unobserved preferences or community characteristics, determine not only the outcomes of interest but also the size and composition of networks. The most important empirical result is that social networks have significant and substantial effects on risk perceptions and the adoption of new behaviors even after we control for unobserved factors. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aKenya; Malawi  aAIDS  a Disease  a Social Networks  aJournal Article  g44g1h1-33tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922352&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200702135naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450061001831000020002447000019002641100021002837100019003045200726003236500042010496500084010916500076011756500109012516510010013606530009013706530014013796530017013936530019014106530012014296530015014416550020014567730029014768560006015058560196015119030018017070922353  a200708       200702                        eng     aEP23779761  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ12  aJ13  aO1510aOrphans and Schooling in Africa: A Longitudinal Analysis10aEvans, David K.10aMiguel, Edward  aRAND Corporation  aU CA, Berkeley  aAIDS deaths could have a major impact on economic development by affecting the human capital accumulation of the next generation.

There is a substantial decrease in school participation following a parent death and a smaller drop before the death (presumably due to pre-death morbidity). Estimated impacts are smaller in specifications without individual fixed effects, suggesting that estimates based on cross-sectional data are biased toward zero. Effects are largest for children whose mothers died and, in a novel finding, for those with low baseline academic performance. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aKenya  aAIDS  a Children  a Development  a Human Capital  a Parent  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g44g1h35-57tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922353&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200702710naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450102001751000022002777000021002991100040003207100011003605201379003716500042017506500076017926500109018686510023019776530010020006530014020106530015020246530015020396530013020546550020020677730029020878560006021168560196021229030018023180922354  a200708       200702                        eng     aEP23779762  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ13  aO1510aEducational Reversals and First-Birth Timing in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Dynamic Multilevel Approach10aDerose, Laurie F.10aKravdal, Oystein  aMD Population Research Center, U MD  aU Oslo  aIn many areas throughout sub-Saharan Africa, young adult cohorts are less educated than their predecessors because of declines in school enrollments during the 1980s and 1990s. Because a woman with little education typically becomes a mother earlier and has more children than one with better education, and because of a similar well-established relationship between current education and current fertility at the societal level, one might expect such education reversals to raise fertility. However, if there is an additional negative effect of low educational level among currently young women compared with that in the past, which would accord with ideas about the impact of relative deprivation, the total effect of an education reversal may run in either direction. This possibility has not been explored in earlier studies, which have taken a more static approach. We focus on the initiation of childbearing. Using Demographic and Health Survey data from 16 sub-Saharan African countries with multiple surveys, we estimate a fixed-effects multilevel model for first births that includes the woman's own education, community education, and community education relative to the past. There are negative effects of individual and community education, but no effect of relative education. Thus we conclude that education reversals do seem to speed up entry into parenthood. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSub-Saharan Africa  aBirth  a Children  a Education  a Fertility  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g44g1h59-77tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922354&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200702709naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450060001831000021002437000020002647000017002841100017003017100016003187100009003345201303003436500048016466500084016946500076017786500066018546510009019206530010019296530014019396530012019536530013019656530012019786530016019906550020020067730029020268560006020558560196020619030018022570922355  a200708       200702                        eng     aEP23779763  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI31  aJ12  aJ13  aJ1610aChild Gender and Father Involvement in Fragile Families10aLundberg, Shelly10aMcLanahan, Sara10aRose, Elaina  aU WA and IZA  aPrinceton U  aU WA  aIn this article, we use data from the first two waves of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to examine the effects of child gender on father involvement and to determine if gender effects differ by parents' marital status. We examine several indicators of father involvement, including whether the father acknowledges "ownership" of the child, whether the parents live together when the child is one year old, and whether the father provides financial support when the child is one year old. We find some evidence that child gender is associated with unmarried father involvement around the time of the child's birth: sons born to unmarried parents are more likely than daughters to receive the father's surname, especially if the mother has no other children. However, one year after birth, we find very little evidence that child gender is related to parents' living arrangements or the amount of time or money fathers invest in their children. In contrast, and consistent with previous research, fathers who are married when their child is born are more likely to live with a son than with a daughter one year after birth. This pattern supports an interpretation of child gender effects based on parental beliefs about the importance of fathers for the long-term development of sons. 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aChild  a Families  a Gender  a Marital  a Parent  a Well Being  aJournal Article  g44g1h79-92tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922355&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200702051naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450072001671000024002391100015002635200965002786500084012436500076013276510009014036530018014126530011014306530014014416530012014556550020014677730030014878560006015178560196015239030018017190922356  a200708       200702                        eng     aEP23779764  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aChild Support and Father-Child Contact: Testing Reciprocal Pathways10aNepomnyaschy, Lenna  aColumbia U  aI use three waves of panel data to examine the relationship between child support payments and fathers' contact with their nonmarital children.

They also demonstrate a large positive relationship between childhood and adult health. Compared with excellent, very good, or good childhood health, poor childhood health is associated with more than three times greater odds of having poor adult self-rated health and twice the risk of a work-limiting disability or a chronic health condition. These associations are independent of childhood and current socioeconomic position and health-related risk behaviors. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildhood  a Health  aJournal Article  g44g1h113-35tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922357&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200702652naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450113001751000025002887000022003131100011003357100011003465201423003576500038017806500076018186500066018946510009019606530014019696530013019836530012019966530012020086550020020207730030020408560006020708560196020769030018022720922358  a200708       200702                        eng     aEP23779758  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aJ1610aGender Differences in the Link between Childhood Socioeconomic Conditions and Heart Attack Risk in Adulthood20aHamil-Luker, Jenifer10aO'Rand, Angela M.  aDuke U  aDuke U  aA growing body of evidence shows that childhood socioeconomic status (SES) is predictive of disease risk in later life, with those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds more likely to experience poor adult-health outcomes. Most of these studies, however, are based on middle-aged male populations and pay insufficient attention to the pathways between childhood risks and specific adult disorders. This article examines gender differences in the link between childhood SES and heart attack risk trajectories and the mechanisms by which early environments affect future disease risk. By using methods that model both latent and path-specific influences, we identify heterogeneity in early life conditions and human, social, and health capital in adulthood that contribute to diverse heart attack risk trajectories between and among men and women as they age into their 60s and 70s. We find that key risk factors for heart attack operate differently for men and women. For men, childhood SES does not differentiate those at low, increasing, and high risk for heart attack. In contrast, women who grew up without a father and/or under adverse economic conditions are the most likely to experience elevated risk for heart attack, even after we adjust for the unequal distribution of working and living conditions, social relationships, access to health care, and adult lifestyle behaviors that influence health outcomes. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aChildhood  a Disease  a Gender  a Health  aJournal Article  g44g1h137-58tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922358&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200702465naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450080001591000022002397000018002617000020002791100014002997100027003137100047003405201368003876500084017556510016018396530012018556530014018676550020018817730030019018560006019318560196019379030018021330922359  a200708       200702                        eng     aEP23779759  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aIncome Dynamics in Couples and the Dissolution of Marriage and Cohabitation10aKalmijn, Matthijs10aLoeve, Anneke10aManting, Dorien  aTilburg U  aStatistics Netherlands  aNetherlands Institute for Spatial Research  aSeveral studies have shown that a wife's strong (socio)economic position is associated with an increase in the risk of divorce. Less is known about such effects for cohabiting relationships. Using a unique and large-scale sample of administrative records from The Netherlands, we analyze the link between couples' income dynamics and union dissolution for married and cohabiting unions over a 10-year period. We find negative effects of household income on separation and positive effects of the woman's relative income, in line with earlier studies. The shape of the effect of the woman's relative income, however, depends on the type of union. Movements away from income equality toward a male-dominant pattern tend to increase the dissolution risk for cohabiting couples, whereas they reduce the dissolution risk for married couples. Movements away from income equality toward a female-dominant pattern (reverse specialization) increase the dissolution risks for both marriage and cohabitation. The findings suggest that equality is more protective for cohabitation, whereas specialization is more protective for marriage, although only when it fits a traditional pattern. Finally, we find that the stabilizing effects of income equality are more pronounced early in the marriage and that income equality also reduces the dissolution risk for same-sex couples. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aNetherlands  aDivorce  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g44g1h159-79tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922359&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200702064naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450074001591000026002337000023002591100014002827100077002965201012003736500098013856510016014836530017014996550020015167730030015368560006015668560196015729030018017680922360  a200708       200702                        eng     aEP23779760  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aZ1310aShould I Stay or Should I Go?

Although largely overlooked by most recent studies on leaving home, life-course theory suggests that age norms and age grading influence life-course decisions in general and leaving home in particular. We use Fishbein and Ajzen's model of "reasoned behavior" to integrate this strand of research with the more individualistic view that dominates current thinking. Using data from a Dutch panel survey, we use a Cox regression model with a control for sample selection to estimate the association between perceived age norms and the timing of leaving home. We show that perceived opinions of parents are associated with the actual timing of leaving the parental home but that societal norms and friends' norms concerning the timing of leaving home are not. In addition, the timing of leaving home is also associated with the perceived costs and benefits of leaving home and with the perceived housing market situation. 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aNetherlands  aSocial Norms  aJournal Article  g44g1h181-98tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0922360&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200702276naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450090001751000021002651100044002865201118003306500094014486500038015426500076015806510009016566530014016656530012016796550020016917730031017118560006017428560196017489030018019440883255  a200701       200611                        eng     aEP23128291  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD63  aI12  aJ1310aReproducing Inequalities: Luck, Wallets, and the Enduring Effects of Childhood Health10aPalloni, Alberto  aCenter for Demography and Ecology, U WI  aIn this article, I argue that research on social stratification, on intergenerational transmission of inequalities, and on the theory of factor payments and wage determination will be strengthened by studying the role played by early childhood health. I show that the inclusion of such a factor requires researchers to integrate theories in each of these fields with new theories linking early childhood health conditions and events that occur at later stages in the life course of individuals, particularly physical and mental health as well as disability and mortality. The empirical evidence I gather shows that early childhood health matters for the achievement of, or social accession to, adult social class positions. Even if the magnitude of associations is not overwhelming, it is not weaker than that found between adult social accession and other, more conventional and better-studied individual characteristics, such as educational attainment. It is very likely that the evidence presented in this article grossly underplays the importance of early childhood health for adult socioeconomic achievement. 4aEquity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement         b(D63) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildhood  a Health  aJournal Article  g43g4h587-615tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0883255&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200602120naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450115001671000020002827000029003027000019003311100012003507100012003627100031003745200856004056500076012616500066013376510009014036530013014126530012014256530015014376530013014526530011014656550020014767730030014968560006015268560196015329030018017280883256  a200701       200611                        eng     aEP23128292  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1610aLess Help for Mother: The Decline in Coresidential Female Support for the Mothers of Young Children, 1880-200010aShort, Susan E.10aGoldscheider, Frances K.10aTorr, Berna M.  aBrown U  aBrown U  aMN Population Center, U MN  aResearch on changes in women's parenting has focused primarily on their increased likelihood of combining parenthood with paid employment, exploring the pressures that result from this "second shift" or "double burden." This article complements this approach by focusing instead on the likely reduction in the help that mothers of small children have received as declines both in fertility and the coresidence of nonnuclear adults have reduced the number of other women in the household. Using national census data for the period 1880 to 2000, we show a substantial decline in the presence and availability of other females in the household, as fewer are coresident and more of those who are coresident are employed or in school. Although all mothers experience this decline, it is most acute for mothers working for pay in nonagricultural activities. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Female  a Fertility  a Mothers  a Women  aJournal Article  g43g4h617-29tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0883256&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200601797naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450088001671000023002557000018002781100036002967100036003325200705003686500038010736500066011116510009011776530014011866530013012006550020012137730030012338560006012638560196012699030018014650883257  a200701       200611                        eng     aEP23128293  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1610aSex Mortality Differences in the United States: The Role of Cohort Smoking Patterns10aPreston, Samuel H.10aWang, Haidong  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aThis article demonstrates that over the period 1948-2003, sex differences in mortality in the age range 50-84 widened and then narrowed on a cohort basis rather than on a period basis. The cohort with the maximum excess of male mortality was born shortly after the turn of the century. Three separate data sources suggest that the turnaround in sex mortality differences is consistent with sex differences in cigarette smoking by cohort. An age-period-cohort model reveals a highly significant effect of smoking histories on men's and women's mortality. Combined with recent changes in smoking patterns, the model suggests that sex differences in mortality will narrow dramatically in coming decades. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aMortality  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g43g4h631-46tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0883257&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200602494naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450083001671000020002507000026002701100022002967100022003185201299003406500077016396500163017166510009018796530010018886530012018986550020019107730030019308560006019608560196019669030018021620883258  a200701       200611                        eng     aEP23128294  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aN3210aVariation in Life Expectancy during the Twentieth Century in the United States10aSmith, David W.10aBradshaw, Benjamin S.  aU TX, San Antonio  aU TX, San Antonio  aThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reports life expectancy at birth (LE) for each year in the United States. Censal year estimates of LE use complete life tables. From 1900 through 1947, LEs for intercensal years were interpolated from decennial life tables and annual crude death rates. Since 1948, estimates have been computed from annual life tables. A substantial drop in variation in LE occurred in the 1940s. To evaluate these methods and examine variation without artifacts of different methods, we estimated a consistent series of both annual abridged life tables and LEs from official NCHS age-specific death rates and also LEs using the interpolation method for 1900-1998. Interpolated LEs are several times as variable as life table estimates, about 2 times as variable before 1940 and about 6.5 times as variable after 1950. Estimates of LE from annual life tables are better measures than those based on the mixed methods detailed in NCHS reports. Estimates from life tables show that the impact of the 1918 influenza pandemic on LE was much smaller than indicated by official statistics. We conclude that NCHS should report official estimates of intercensal LE for 1900-1948 computed from life tables in place of the existing LEs that were computed by interpolation. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Deaths  aJournal Article  g43g4h647-57tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0883258&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200602230naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450142001671000021003097000021003301100017003517100009003685200947003776500084013246500076014086510009014846530013014936530013015066530012015196530013015316530014015446530012015586530016015706550020015867730030016068560006016368560196016429030018018380883259  a200701       200611                        eng     aEP23128295  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1313aThe Influence of Parents' Marital Quality on Adult Children's Attitudes toward Marriage and Its Alternatives: Main and Moderating Effects10aCunningham, Mick10aThornton, Arland  aWestern WA U  aU MI  aDrawing on a panel study of parents and children, we investigate linkages between parents' marital quality and adult children's attitudes toward a range of family issues, including premarital sex, cohabitation, lifelong singlehood, and divorce. We hypothesize that parents' marital quality will be negatively related to children's support for these behaviors in adulthood and that parents' marital quality will condition the intergenerational transmission of attitudes toward these issues. We find some evidence that parents' marital quality influences children's support for divorce and premarital sex. More important, our analyses show that parents' marital quality facilitates the intergenerational transmission of attitudes. Parents' attitudes toward premarital sex, cohabitation, and being single are more strongly linked to those same attitudes among their young adult children when parents' marital quality is high than when it is low. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Divorce  a Family  a Marital  a Marriage  a Parent  a Premarital  aJournal Article  g43g4h659-72tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0883259&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200602016naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450051001671000022002181100015002405201035002556500042012906500113013326510009014456530014014546550020014687730030014888560006015188560196015249030018017200883260  a200701       200611                        eng     aEP23128296  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ1510aEducation and Black-White Interracial Marriage10aGullickson, Aaron  aColumbia U  aThis article examines competing theoretical claims regarding how an individual's education will affect his or her likelihood of interracial marriage. I demonstrate that prior models of interracial marriage have failed to adequately distinguish the joint and marginal effects of education on interracial marriage and present a model capable of distinguishing these effects. I test this model on black-white interracial marriages using 1980, 1990, and 2000 U.S. census data. The results reveal partial support for status exchange theory within black male-white female unions and strong isolation of lower-class blacks from the interracial marriage market. Structural assimilation theory is not supported because the educational attainment of whites is not related in any consistent fashion to the likelihood of interracial marriage. The strong isolation of lower-class blacks from the interracial marriage market has gone unnoticed in prior research because of the failure of prior methods to distinguish joint and marginal effects. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aEducation  aJournal Article  g43g4h673-89tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0883260&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200601768naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450098001751000020002737000022002937000019003151100050003347100027003847100015004115200488004266500038009146500084009526500064010366510009011006530013011096530013011226550020011357730031011558560006011868560196011929030018013880883261  a200701       200611                        eng     aEP23128297  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ12  aK4210aCleaning Up Their Act: The Effects of Marriage and Cohabitation on Licit and Illicit Drug Use10aDuncan, Greg J.10aWilkerson, Bessie10aEngland, Paula  aInstitute for Policy Research, Northwestern U  aHarlem Children's Zone  aStanford U  aWe use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to estimate changes in binge drinking, marijuana use, and cigarette smoking surrounding young adults' first experiences of cohabitation and marriage.

In contrast to previous results in the literature, event-history analysis of the longitudinal data reveals a positive, not a negative, effect of lagged migration experience on the likelihood of marriage. The findings also indicate gender differences.

Landless and semilandless families responded strongly to short-term economic stress stemming from changes in prices. The fertility response, both to moderate and large changes in food prices, was the strongest within six months after prices changed in the fall, which means that the response was deliberate. People foresaw bad times and planned their fertility accordingly. The result highlights the importance of deliberate control of the timing of childbirth before the fertility transition, not in order to achieve a certain family size but, as in this case, to reduce the negative impacts of short-term economic stress. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aDemographic Economics: Public Policy         b(J18) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Europe: Pre-1913         b(N33)  aSweden  aFertility  aJournal Article  g43g4h727-46tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0883263&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200602365naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450118001671000015002857000017003001100009003177100009003265201282003356500052016176500076016696510009017456530015017546530012017696550020017817730030018018560006018318560196018379030018020330883264  a200701       200611                        eng     aEP23128300  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI11  aJ1311aAge at First Sexual Intercourse, Genes, and Social Context: Evidence from Twins and the Dopamine D4 Receptor Gene10aGuo, Guang10aTong, Yuying  aU NC  aU NC  aWe carried out two distinct types of genetic analysis with data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The first was a non-DNA twin analysis using monozygotic (identical) and same-sex dizygotic (fraternal) twins. The second analysis investigates the association between age at first sexual intercourse and the 48-bp repeat polymorphism in the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4). The twin analysis shows that MZ twins correlate their timing of first sex to a much greater extent than do the samesex DZ twins. Our analysis of the polymorphisms in DRD4 indicates that those with an any-3R genotype experienced a risk of first sexual intercourse 23% (p = .016), 233% (p = .0001), 28% (p = .012), and 69% (p = .006) higher than those with an other/other (or any-4R) genotype in the all-ethnicities (n = 2,552), Asian, white, and Hispanic samples, respectively. The risk of first sex does not differ between the two genotypes in the African American sample. These results were obtained after adjusting the standard socioeconomic covariates, including gender, parental education, family structure, and community poverty in the regression model. Evidence from both twin and genetic-variant analyses points to a role of genes in the timing of first sexual intercourse. 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAdolescent  a Health  aJournal Article  g43g4h747-69tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0883264&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200602749naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450093001751000015002687000021002831100068003047100068003725201331004406500042017716500076018136500109018896510017019986530010020156530014020256530018020396530013020576530010020706530015020806550020020957730030021158560006021458560196021519030016023470869387  a200611       200608                        eng     aEP23128282  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ13  aO1513aThe Impact of Parental Death on School Outcomes: Longitudinal Evidence from South Africa10aCase, Anne10aArdington, Cally  aPrinceton U and Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies  aU Cape Town and Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies  aWe analyze longitudinal data from a demographic surveillance area (DSA) in KwaZulu-Natal to examine the impact of parental death on children's outcomes. The results show significant differences in the impact of mothers' and fathers' deaths. The loss of a child's mother is a strong predictor of poor schooling outcomes. Maternal orphans are significantly less likely to be enrolled in school and have completed significantly fewer years of schooling, conditional on age, than children whose mothers are alive. Less money is spent on maternal orphans' educations, on average, conditional on enrollment. Moreover, children whose mothers have died appear to be at an educational disadvantage when compared with non-orphaned children with whom they live. We use the timing of mothers' deaths relative to children's educational shortfalls to argue that mothers' deaths have a causal effect on children's educations. The loss of a child's father is a significant correlate of poor household socioeconomic status. However, the death of a father between waves of the survey has no significant effect on subsequent asset ownership. Evidence from the South African 2001 Census suggests that the estimated effects of maternal deaths on children's outcomes in the Africa Centre DSA reflect the reality for orphans throughout South Africa. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSouth Africa  aChild  a Children  a Demographics  a Mothers  a Poor  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g43g3h401-20tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869387&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200601852naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450083001671000021002501100015002715200769002866500069010556500084011246510009012086530013012176530012012306530012012426530016012546550020012707730030012908560006013208560196013269030016015220869388  a200611       200608                        eng     aEP23128283  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD31  aJ1210aFamily Structure and Income Inequality in Families with Children, 1976 to 200010aMartin, Molly A.  aPA State U  aUsing 24 years of data from the March supplements to the Current Population Survey and detailed categories of family structure, including cohabiting unions, I assess the contribution of changes in family structure to the dramatic rise in family income inequality. Between 1976 and 2000, family structure shifts explain 41% of the increase in inequality, but the influence of family structure change is not uniform within this period or across racial-ethnic groups. In general, the estimated role of family structure change is inversely related to the magnitude of the changes in inequality. Furthermore, by including cohabitation, I find lower levels of total inequality and a weaker role for demographic shifts in family structure for trends in income inequality. 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aFamilies  a Family  a Income  a Inequality  aJournal Article  g43g3h421-45tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869388&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200602418naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450059001751000020002341100026002545201180002806500048014606500084015086500076015926510009016686530015016776530017016926530014017096530012017236530013017356530012017486530016017606550020017767730030017968560006018268560196018329030016020280869389  a200611       200608                        eng     aEP23128284  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI31  aJ12  aJ1310aFamily Structure Transitions and Adolescent Well-Being10aBrown, Susan L.  aBowling Green State U  aUsing data from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I extend prior research on family transitions and adolescent well-being by examining the influence of parental marital and cohabitation transitions on adolescent delinquency, depression, and school engagement. Adolescents who experienced a family transition reported decreased well-being, on average, relative to those in stable, two-biological-parent families. Specific comparisons of various types of family stability and change revealed that cohabitation is often associated with poorer outcomes. Moving out of a cohabiting stepfamily into a single-mother family was not harmful and was actually associated with improvements in school engagement. Moving into a cohabiting stepfamily from a single-mother family decreased adolescent well-being, and this impact was greater than that experienced by those who moved into a married stepfamily. Stable cohabiting stepfamilies were associated with lower levels of well-being than stable married stepfamilies. Formalization of a cohabiting stepfamily through marriage did not translate into any appreciable benefits for adolescent well-being. 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAdolescent  a Delinquency  a Families  a Family  a Marital  a Parent  a Well Being  aJournal Article  g43g3h447-61tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869389&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200602168naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450064001671000017002317000019002481100014002677100014002815201132002956500038014276500084014656510011015496530012015606530014015726550020015867730030016068560006016368560196016429030016018380869390  a200611       200608                        eng     aEP23128285  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1210aEstimating a Marriage Matching Model with Spillover Effects10aChoo, Eugene10aSiow, Aloysius  aU Toronto  aU Toronto  aWe use marriage matching functions to study how marital patterns change when population supplies change. Specifically, we use a behavioral marriage matching function with spill over effects to rationalize marriage and cohabitation behavior in contemporary Canada. The model can estimate a couple's systematic gains to marriage and cohabitation relative to remaining single. These gains are invariant to changes in population supplies. Instead, changes in population supplies redistribute these gains between a couple. Although the model is behavioral, it is nonparametric. It can fit any observed cross-sectional marriage matching distribution. We use the estimated model to quantify the impacts of gender differences in mortality rates and the baby boom on observed marital behavior in Canada. The higher mortality rate of men makes men scarcer than women. We show that the scarceness of men modestly reduced the welfare of women and increased the welfare of men in the marriage market. On the other hand, the baby boom increased older men's net gains to entering the marriage market and lowered middle-aged women's net gains. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aCanada  aMarital  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g43g3h463-90tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869390&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200601928naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450118001591000017002771100014002945200966003086500113012746510009013876530009013966550020014057730031014258560006014568560196014629030016016580869391  a200611       200608                        eng     aEP23128286  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1510aFriends for Better or for Worse: Interracial Friendship in the United States as Seen through Wedding Party Photos10aBerry, Brent  aU Toronto  aFriendship patterns are instrumental for testing important hypotheses about assimilation processes and group boundaries. Wedding photos provide an opportunity to directly observe a realistic representation of close interracial friendships and race relations. An analysis of 1,135 wedding party photos and related information shows that whites are especially unlikely to have black friends who are close enough to be in their wedding party. Adjusting for group size, whites and East and Southeast Asians (hereafter, E/SE Asians) are equally likely to be in each other's weddings, but whites invite blacks to be in their wedding parties only half as much as blacks invite whites, and E/SE Asians invite blacks only one-fifth as much as blacks invite E/SE Asians. In interracial marriages, both E/SE Asian and black spouses in marriages to whites are significantly less likely than their white spouses to have close friendships with members of their spouse's race. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aRace  aJournal Article  g43g3h491-510tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869391&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200601972naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450079001671000024002467000028002707000016002981100009003147100009003237100009003325200837003416500042011786500113012206510009013336530014013426530010013566550020013667730030013868560006014168560196014229030016016180869392  a200611       200608                        eng     aEP23128287  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ1510aMaking It in America: High School Completion by Immigrant and Native Youth10aPerreira, Krista M.10aHarris, Kathleen Mullan10aLee, Dohoon  aU NC  aU NC  aU NC  aUsing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we find that first-generation youth of Hispanic, Asian, and African heritage obtain more education than their parents, but the second generation and third or higher generations lose ground. Differences in dropout rates by race-ethnicity and immigrant generation are driven by differences in human, cultural, and social capital. Low levels of family human capital, school social capital, and community social capital place the children of immigrants at risk of dropping out. However, cultural capital and immigrant optimism buffer first-generation Hispanic youth and the children of Asian immigrants from the risk of dropping out of high school. While human and social capital resources improve with immigrant generation, cultural capital diminishes. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aEducation  a Race  aJournal Article  g43g3h511-36tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869392&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200601632naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450057001591000017002161100034002335200793002676500053010606510009011136550020011227730030011428560006011728560196011789030016013740869393  a200611       200608                        eng     aEP23128288  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ2210aMale Nonworkers: Who Are They and Who Supports Them?10aStewart, Jay  aUS Bureau of Labor Statistics  aAlthough male nonworkers have become a larger fraction of the population since the late 1960s, very little is known about who they are or who supports them. Using data from the March Current Population Survey and the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, this article fills that void. The picture that emerges is that there is a small cadre of marginal workers who often do not work for periods of a year or more. The vast majority of nonworking men (men who do not work at all during the year) receive unearned income from at least one source, and the amount of unearned income they receive varies significantly by their reason for not working. Family members provide an important alternative source of support for nonworking men who have little or no unearned income of their own. 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g43g3h537-52tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869393&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200602426naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450062001671000019002297000027002481100015002757100019002905201373003096500077016826500076017596510009018356530012018446550020018567730030018768560006019068560196019129030016021080869394  a200611       200608                        eng     aEP23128289  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ1310aMultistate Cohort Models with Proportional Transfer Rates10aSchoen, Robert20aCanudas-Romo, Vladimir  aPA State U  aU CA, Berkeley  aWe present a new, broadly applicable approach to summarizing the behavior of a cohort as it moves through a variety of statuses (or states). The approach is based on the assumption that all rates of transfer maintain a constant ratio to one another over age. We present closed-form expressions for the size and state composition of the cohort at every age and provide expressions for other useful summary measures. The state trajectories, or life course schematics, depict all the possible size and state configurations that the cohort can exhibit over its life course under the specified pattern of transfer rates. The two living state case and hierarchical multistate models with any number of living states are analyzed in detail. Applying our approach to 1997 U.S. fertility data, we find that observed rates of parity progression are roughly proportional over age. Our proportional transfer rate approach provides trajectories by parity state and facilitates analyses of the implications of changes in parity rate levels and patterns. More women complete childbearing at parity 2 than at any other parity, and parity 2 would be the modal parity in models with total fertility rates (TFRs) of 1.40 to 2.61. Increases in parity progression rates to parities 4 and above have little effect on a cohort's TFR, while changes in childlessness have a substantial impact. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aCohorts  aJournal Article  g43g3h553-68tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869394&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200601705naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450098001591000023002577000015002801100057002957100014003525200696003666500038010626530011011006530021011116530015011326550020011477730030011678560006011978560196012039030016013990869395  a200611       200608                        eng     aEP23128290  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1210aDeath by Survey: Estimating Adult Mortality without Selection Bias from Sibling Survival Data10aGakidou, Emmanuela10aKing, Gary  aInstitute for Quantitative Social Science, Harvard U  aHarvard U  aThe widely used methods for estimating adult mortality rates from sample survey responses about the survival of siblings, parents, spouses, and others depend crucially on an assumption that, as we demonstrate, does not hold in real data. We show that when this assumption is violated so that the mortality rate varies with sibship size, mortality estimates can be massively biased. By using insights from work on the statistical analysis of selection bias, survey weighting, and extrapolation problems, we propose a new and relatively simple method of recovering the mortality rate with both greatly reduced potential for bias and increased clarity about the source of necessary assumptions. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aDeaths  a Mortality Rates  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g43g3h569-85tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869395&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200601743naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450116001591000023002757000021002981100088003197100024004075200661004316500084010926510011011766530013011876550020012007730030012208560006012508560196012569030013014520869377  a200611       200605                        eng     aEP21393558  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aUnmarried Cohabitation and Union Stability: Testing the Role of Diffusion Using Data from 16 European Countries10aLiefbroer, Aart C.10aDourleijn, Edith  aNetherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute, The Hague and Free U Amsterdam  aErasmus U Rotterdam  aCohabitors and married people who cohabited before marriage have higher risks of union dissolution than people who married without prior cohabitation.

The results support our hypothesis: former cohabitors run a higher risk of union dissolution than people who married without prior cohabitation only in societies in which cohabitation is a small minority or a large majority phenomenon. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aEurope  aMarriage  aJournal Article  g43g2h203-21tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869377&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200602486naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450075001671000023002427000019002657000023002841100014003077100015003217100015003365201324003516500084016756500066017596510009018256530013018346530013018476530011018606550020018717730030018918560006019218560196019279030013021230869378  a200611       200605                        eng     aEP21393561  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1610aMarriage or Dissolution?

We use the newly released cohabitation data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979-2000), which tracks the partners of cohabiting women across survey waves. Our results support several conclusions. First, cohabiting unions are short-lived--about one-half end within one year, and over 90% end by the fifth year. Unlike most previous research, our results show that most cohabiting unions end by dissolution of the relationship rather than by marriage. Second, transitions to marriage are especially unlikely among poor women; less than one-third marry within five years. Cohabitation among poor women is more likely than that among non-poor women to be a long-term alternative or substitute for traditional marriage. Third, our multinomial analysis of transitions from cohabitation into marriage or dissolution highlights the salience of economically disadvantaged family backgrounds, cohabitation and fertility histories, women's economic resources, and partner characteristics. These results are interpreted in a policy environment that increasingly views marriage as an economic panacea for low-income women and their children. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aMarriage  a Mothers  a Women  aJournal Article  g43g2h223-40tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869378&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200601704naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450082001671000018002497000019002677000015002861100009003017100009003107100009003195200553003286500084008816500076009656510009010416530010010506530015010606530014010756550020010897730030011098560006011398560196011459030013013410869379  a200611       200605                        eng     aEP21393566  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1313aThe Rising Share of Nonmarital Births: Fertility Choice or Marriage Behavior?10aGray, Jo Anna10aStockard, Jean10aStone, Joe  aU OR  aU OR  aU OR  aMuch of the sharp rise in the share of nonmarital births in the United States has been attributed to changes in the fertility choices of unmarried and married women--in response, it is often argued, to public policy.

If this is true, one should expect to find no evidence of such preferences in countries with a high level of gender equality. In this article, we exploit data from population registers from Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden to examine continuities and changes in parental sex preferences in the Nordic countries during the past three to four decades. First, we do not observe an effect of the sex of the firstborn child on second-birth risks. Second, we detect a distinct preference for at least one child of each sex among parents of two children. For third births, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish parents seem to develop a preference for having a daughter, while Finns exhibit a significant preference for having a son. These findings show that modernization and more equal opportunities for women and men do not necessarily lead to parental gender indifference. On the contrary, they may even result in new sex preferences. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aDenmark; Finland; Norway; Sweden  aChildbearing  a Children  aJournal Article  g43g2h255-67tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869380&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200601562naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450078001591000017002377000018002541100009002727100017002815200595002986500076008936510013009696530010009826530015009926550020010077730030010278560006010578560196010639030013012590869381  a200611       200605                        eng     aEP21393639  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aSex Preferences and Fertility in South Korea during the Year of the Horse10aLee, Jungmin10aPaik, Myungho  aU AK  aU TX, Austin  aSince antiquity, people in several East Asian countries, such as China, Japan, and South Korea, have believed that a person is destined to possess specific characteristics according to the sign of the zodiac under which he or she was born. South Koreans, in particular, have traditionally considered that the year of the Horse bears inauspicious implications for the birth of daughters. Using monthly longitudinal data at the region level in South Korea between 1970 and 2003, we found that in the year of the Horse, the sex ratio at birth significantly increased while fertility decreased. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aS.

We study the potential determinants of this "healthy immigrant effect," with a particular focus on the tendency of immigrants to converge to unhealthy American BMI levels. Using data from the National Health Interview Survey, we find that average female and male immigrants enter the United States with BMIs that are approximately two and five percentage points lower than native-born women and men, respectively. Consistent with the declining health status of immigrants the longer they remain in the United States, we also find that female immigrants almost completely converge to American BMIs within 10 years of arrival, and men close a third of the gap within 15 years. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aHealth  a Immigrant  aJournal Article  g43g2h337-60tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869384&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200603047naa  2200433   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450085001751000023002607000018002837000019003017000023003201100026003437100070003697100017004397100024004565201572004806500038020526500077020906500076021676510009022436530017022526530016022696530015022856530017023006530015023176530016023326550020023487730030023688560006023988560196024049030013026000869385  a200611       200605                        eng     aEP21393654  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ11  aJ1310aForeign-Born Emigration: A New Approach and Estimates Based on Matched CPS Files10aVan Hook, Jennifer10aZhang, Weiwei10aBean, Frank D.10aPassel, Jeffrey S.  aBowling Green State U  aCenter for Family and Demographic Research, Bowling Green State U  aU CA, Irvine  aPew Hispanic Center  aThe utility of postcensal population estimates depends on the adequate measurement of four major components of demographic change: fertility, mortality, immigration, and emigration. Of the four components, emigration, especially of the foreign-born, has proved the most difficult to gauge. Without "direct" methods (i.e., methods identifying who emigrates and when), demographers have relied on indirect approaches, such as residual methods. Residual estimates, however, are sensitive to inaccuracies in their constituent parts and are particularly ill-suited for measuring the emigration of recent arrivals. Here we introduce a new method for estimating foreign-born emigration that takes advantage of the sample design of the Current Population Survey (CPS): repeated interviews of persons in the same housing units over a period of 16 months. Individuals appearing in a first March Supplement to the CPS but not the next include those who died in the intervening year, those who moved within the country, and those who emigrated. We use statistical methods to estimate the proportion of emigrants among those not present in the follow-up interview. Our method produces emigration estimates that are comparable to those from residual methods in the case of longer-term residents (immigrants who arrived more than 10 years ago), but yields higher--and what appear to be more accurate--estimates for recent arrivals. Although somewhat constrained by sample size, we also generate estimates by age, sex, region of birth, and duration of residence in the United States. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Emigration  a Fertility  a Immigration  a Mortality  a Population  aJournal Article  g43g2h361-82tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869385&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200602854naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450087001911000016002787000016002941100009003107100009003195201382003286500113017106500055018236500038018786500172019166500081020886510009021696530013021786530012021916550020022037730030022238560006022538560196022599030013024550869386  a200611       200605                        eng     aEP21393658  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aQ51  aR14  aR23  aR5210aReassessing Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Environmental Justice Research10aMohai, Paul10aSaha, Robin  aU MI  aU MT  aThe number of studies examining racial and socioeconomic disparities in the geographic distribution of environmental hazards and locally unwanted land uses has grown considerably over the past decade. Most studies have found statistically significant racial and socioeconomic disparities associated with hazardous sites. However, there is considerable variation in the magnitude of racial and socioeconomic disparities found; indeed, some studies have found none. Uncertainties also exist about the underlying causes of the disparities. Many of these uncertainties can be attributed to the failure of the most widely used method for assessing environmental disparities to adequately account for proximity between the hazard under investigation and nearby residential populations. In this article, we identify the reasons for and consequences of this failure and demonstrate ways of overcoming these shortcomings by using alternate, distance-based methods. Through the application of such methods, we show how assessments about the magnitude and causes of racial and socioeconomic disparities in the distribution of hazardous sites are changed. In addition to research on environmental inequality, we discuss how distance-based methods can be usefully applied to other areas of demographic research that explore the effects of neighborhood context on a range of social outcomes. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aValuation of Environmental Effects         b(Q51) 4aLand Use Patterns         b(R14) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aRegional Government Analysis: Land Use and Other Regulations         b(R52)  aU.S.  aLand Use  a Racial  aJournal Article  g43g2h383-99tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0869386&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200602214naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450103001751000023002787000022003011100015003237100015003385201006003536500042013596500066014016500083014676510009015506530014015596530012015736530011015856550020015967730028016168560006016448560196016509030018018460832872  a200605       200602                        eng     aEP20312677  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ16  aJ2410aGender-Specific Trends in the Value of Education and the Emerging Gender Gap in College Completion10aDiPrete, Thomas A.10aBuchmann, Claudia  aColumbia U  aOH State U  aAnalysis of March Current Population Survey data from 1964 through 2002 shows that white women overtook white men in their rates of college completion and that this phenomenon occurred during a period in which women's standard-of-living gains from college completion grew at a faster rate than those for men. We assess whether these trends are related to changes in the value of education for men and women in terms of earnings returns to higher education, the probability of getting and staying married, education-related differences in family standard of living, and insurance against living in poverty. Although returns to a college education in the form of earnings remained higher for women than for men over the entire period, trends in these returns do not provide a plausible explanation for gender-specific trends in college completion. But when broader measures of material well-being are taken into account, women's returns to higher education appear to have risen faster than those of men. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24)  aU.S.  aEducation  a Gender  a Women  aJournal Article  g43g1h1-24tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0832872&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200602358naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450079001911000033002707000023003031100014003267100014003405200869003546500042012236500084012656500067013496500109014166500119015256510033016446530011016776530015016886550020017037730029017238560006017528560196017589030018019540832873  a200605       200602                        eng     aEP20312678  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ12  aO12  aO15  aO1810aFamily Size and Schooling in Sub-Saharan African Settings: A Reexamination20aEloundou-Enyegue, Parfait M.10aWilliams, Lindy B.  aCornell U  aCornell U  aContrary to theory and evidence from many other regions, previous studies in sub-Saharan Africa have found surprisingly weak associations between family size and schooling. It is unclear, however, whether these weak results reflect (spurious) limitations in methodology or (real) differences in context. This study uses schooling histories from Cameroon to test four contending methodological and contextual explanations for these weak results: measurement bias, statistical estimation bias, family buffering, and socioeconomic context. We find the strongest support for the last explanation: the relationship between family size and schooling varies with spatial and historical context. This relationship has strengthened within the country over time, and this raises concern about the implications of current demographic transitions on inequality among children. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aMicroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development         b(O12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18)  aCameroon; Sub-Saharan Africa  aFamily  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g43g1h25-52tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0832873&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200602307naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450085001671000024002521100009002765201166002856500084014516500076015356510009016116530010016206530014016306530018016446530014016626530012016766530012016886550020017007730029017208560006017498560196017559030018019510832874  a200605       200602                        eng     aEP20312679  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aResidential Father Family Type and Child Well-Being: Investment versus Selection10aHofferth, Sandra L.  aU MD  aThis research links residence with biological and nonbiological married and unmarried parents to the cognitive achievement and behavioral problems of children aged 3-12, controlling for factors that make such families different. The data were drawn from the 1997 Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Achievement differences were not associated with father family structure per se, but with demographic and economic factors that differ across families. In contrast, behavioral problems were linked to family structure even after controls for measured and unmeasured factors were included. Children in all family types except the married-biological-parent family showed higher levels of behavioral problems. Paternal and maternal engagement time explained some of the differences in behavioral problems across families. Although children in blended families tended to achieve at lower levels than those not in blended families, stepchildren in blended families achieved at levels comparable to those of half-siblings. Finally, children in blended families tended to have fewer behavioral problems than those not in blended families. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Demographics  a Families  a Family  a Parent  aJournal Article  g43g1h53-77tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0832874&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200602275naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450064001591000022002237000017002457000019002627000027002811100050003087100022003587100022003807100011004025201072004136500084014856510019015696530017015886530013016056530014016186530012016326550020016447730029016648560006016938560196016999030018018950832875  a200605       200602                        eng     aEP20312680  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1213aThe Demographics of Same-Sex Marriages in Norway and Sweden10aAndersson, Gunnar10aNoack, Turid10aSeierstad, Ane20aWeedon-Fekjaer, Harald  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research  aStatistics Norway  aStatistics Norway  aU Oslo  aThe present study investigates the demographics of same-sex marriages--that is, registered partnerships--in Norway and Sweden. We give an overview of the demographic characteristics of the spouses of these partnerships, study patterns of their divorce risks, and compare the dynamics of same-sex couples with those of heterosexual marriages. We use longitudinal information from the population registers of the two countries that cover all persons in partnerships. Our demographic analyses include information on characteristics such as age, sex, geographic background, experience of previous opposite-sex marriage, parenthood, and educational attainment of the partners involved. The results show that in many respects, the distributions of married populations on these characteristics differ by the sex composition of the couples. Patterns in divorce risks are rather similar in same-sex and opposite-sex marriages, but divorce-risk levels are considerably higher in same-sex marriages. The divorce risk for female partnerships is double that for male partnerships. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aNorway; Sweden  aDemographics  a Divorce  a Marriage  a Spouse  aJournal Article  g43g1h79-98tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0832875&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200602001naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450083001751000023002587000017002811100051002987100054003495200691004036500084010946500067011786500109012456510013013546530012013676530014013796550020013937730030014138560006014438560196014499030018016450832876  a200605       200602                        eng     aEP20312681  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aO12  aO1510aDo Marriages Forget Their Past?

Although there is evidence of declining marital stability in the most recent period, marriages contracted under the KR appear as stable as adjacent marriage cohorts. These findings suggest that the conditions under which spouses were initially paired matter less for marital stability than does their contemporaneous environment. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aMicroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development         b(O12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aCambodia  aMarital  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g43g1h99-125tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0832876&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200601956naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450066001591000025002257000023002501100009002737100016002825200979002986500084012776510009013616530012013706530014013826550020013967730030014168560006014468560196014529030018016480832877  a200605       200602                        eng     aEP20312682  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aWhy Are Cohabiting Relationships More Violent Than Marriages?10aKenney, Catherine T.10aMcLanahan, Sara S.  aU IL  aPrinceton U  aIn response to increases in cohabitation in the United States, researchers have recently focused on differences between cohabiting and marital unions. One consistent finding is a higher rate of domestic violence among cohabiting couples as compared with married couples. A prominent explanation for this finding is that cohabitation is governed by a different set of institutionalized controls than marriage. This article explores an alternative explanation, namely, that differences in selection out of cohabitation and marriage, including selection of the least-violent cohabiting couples into marriage and the most-violent married couples into divorce, lead to higher observed rates of violence among cohabiting couples in cross-sectional samples. Our results suggest that researchers should be cautious when making comparisons between married and cohabiting couples in which the dependent variable of interest is related to selection into and out of relationship status. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aMarital  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g43g1h127-40tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0832877&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200602455naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450093001751000022002687000024002907000023003141100037003377100011003747100011003855201192003966500038015886500113016266500049017396510009017886530014017976530012018116550020018237730030018438560006018738560196018799030018020750832878  a200605       200602                        eng     aEP20312683  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ15  aZ1210aReligious Attendance and Mortality: Implications for the Black-White Mortality Crossover10aDupre, Matthew E.10aFranzese, Alexis T.10aParrado, Emilio A.  aCarolina Population Center, U NC  aDuke U  aDuke U  aThis study investigates the relationships among religious attendance, mortality, and the black-white mortality crossover. We build on prior research by examining the link between attendance and mortality while testing whether religious involvement captures an important source of population heterogeneity that contributes to a crossover. Using data from the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, we find a strong negative association between attendance and mortality. Our results also show evidence of a racial crossover in mortality rates for both men and women. When religious attendance is modeled in terms of differential frailty, clear gender differences emerge. For women, the effect of attendance is race- and age-dependent, modifying the age at crossover by 10 years. For men, however, the effect of attendance is not related to race and does not alter the crossover pattern. When other health risks are modeled in terms of differential frailty, we find neither race nor age-related effects. Overall, the results highlight the importance of considering religious attendance when examining racial and gender differences in age-specific mortality rates. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aCultural Economics: Religion         b(Z12)  aU.S.  aMortality  a Racial  aJournal Article  g43g1h141-64tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0832878&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200602103naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450081001671000028002487000020002767000022002967000018003181100047003367100047003837100047004307100043004775200795005206500038013156500108013536510011014616530011014726550020014837730030015038560006015338560196015399030018017350832879  a200605       200602                        eng     aEP20312684  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1410aMeasurement of Cumulative Physiological Dysregulation in an Older Population10aSeplaki, Christopher L.10aGoldman, Noreen10aWeinstein, Maxine10aLin, Yu-Hsuan  aOffice of Population Research, Princeton U  aOffice of Population Research, Princeton U  aCenter for Population Health, Georgetown U  aDepartment of Health, Taichung, Taiwan  aThe allostatic load framework postulates that an important pathway connecting the social environment with health involves biological responses to stressful stimuli and the subsequent dysregulation of interrelated physiological systems.

Drawing on prior studies that have hypothesized that experiences of discrimination increase the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight, this study explores whether there was an effect on birth outcomes for pregnant women of Arab descent. California birth certificate data are used to determine the relative risk of poor birth outcomes by race, ethnicity, and nativity for women who gave birth in the six months following September 2001, compared with the same six calendar months one year earlier. The relative risk of poor birth outcomes was significantly elevated for Arabic-named women and not for any of the other groups. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Discrimination  a Pregnant  aJournal Article  g43g1h185-201tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0832880&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200603022naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450041001911000023002321100009002555201356002646500077016206500166016976500163018636500172020266500098021986510009022966530012023056530015023176530017023326530016023496550020023657730031023858560006024168560196024229030018026180818365  a200602       200511                        eng     aEP19525705  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aN31  aN32  aR23  aZ1310aImmigration and the American Century10aHirschman, Charles  aU WA  aThe full impact of immigration on American society is obscured in policy and academic analyses that focus on the short-term problems of immigrant adjustment. With a longer-term perspective, which includes the socioeconomic roles of the children of immigrants, immigration appears as one of the defining characteristics of twentieth-century America. Major waves of immigration create population diversity with new languages and cultures, but over time, while immigrants and their descendants become more "American," the character of American society and culture is transformed. In the early decades of the twentieth century, immigrants and their children were the majority of the workforce in many of the largest industrial cities; in recent decades, the arrival of immigrants and their families has slowed the demographic and economic decline of some American cities. The presence of immigrants probably creates as many jobs for native-born workers as are lost through displacement. Immigrants and their children played an important role in twentieth-century American politics and were influential in the development of American popular culture during the middle decades of the twentieth century. Intermarriage between the descendants of immigrants and old-stock Americans fosters a national identity based on civic participation rather than ancestry. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aU.S.  aCulture  a Immigrant  a Immigration  a Population  aJournal Article  g42g4h595-620tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0818365&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200502530naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450065001751000027002407000020002671100009002877100009002965201318003056500042016236500084016656500163017496510009019126530013019216550020019347730030019548560006019848560196019909030018021860818366  a200602       200511                        eng     aEP19525706  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ12  aN3210aTrends in Educational Assortative Marriage from 1940 to 200310aSchwartz, Christine R.10aMare, Robert D.  aUCLA  aUCLA  aThis paper reports trends in educational assortative marriage from 1940 to 2003 in the United States. Analyses of census and Current Population Survey data show that educational homogamy decreased from 1940 to 1960 but increased from 1960 to 2003. From 1960 to the early 1970s, increases in educational homogamy were generated by decreasing intermarriage among groups of relatively well-educated persons. College graduates, in particular, were increasingly likely to marry each other rather than those with less education. Beginning in the early 1970s, however, continued increases in the odds of educational homogamy were generated by decreases in intermarriage at both ends of the education distribution. Most striking is the decline in the odds that those with very low levels of education marry up. Intermarriage between college graduates and those with "some college" continued to decline but at a more gradual pace. As intermarriage declined at the extremes of the education distribution, intermarriage among those in the middle portion of the distribution increased. These trends, which are similar for a broad cross section of married couples and for newlyweds, are consistent with a growing social divide between those with very low levels of education and those with more education in the United States. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32)  aU.S.  aMarriage  aJournal Article  g42g4h621-46tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0818366&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200502572naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450100001671000018002677000025002857000022003107000019003321100014003517100037003657100014004027100037004165201182004536500084016356500076017196510009017956530017018046530014018216530015018356530013018506530014018636530015018776550020018927730030019128560006019428560196019489030018021440818367  a200602       200511                        eng     aEP19525707  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1313aThe Relationship between Childbearing and Transitions from Marriage and Cohabitation in Britain10aSteele, Fiona10aKallis, Constantinos10aGoldstein, Harvey10aJoshi, Heather  aU Bristol  aInstitute of Education, U London  aU Bristol  aInstitute of Education, U London  aIn this article, we describe a general framework for the analysis of correlated event histories, with an application to a study of partnership transitions and fertility among a cohort of British women. Using a multilevel, multistate competing-risks model, we examine the relationship between prior fertility outcomes (the presence and characteristics of children and current pregnancy) and the dissolution of marital and cohabiting unions and movements from cohabitation to marriage. Using a simultaneous-equations model, we model these partnership transitions jointly with fertility, allowing for correlation between the unobserved woman-level characteristics that affect each process. The analysis is based on the partnership and birth histories that were collected for the 1958 birth cohort (National Child Development Study) aged 16-42. The findings indicate that preschool children have a stabilizing effect on their parents' partnership, whether married or cohabiting, but the effect is weaker for older children. There is also evidence that although pregnancy precipitates marriage among cohabitors, the odds of marriage decline to prepregnancy levels following a birth. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.K.  aChildbearing  a Children  a Fertility  a Marital  a Marriage  a Pregnancy  aJournal Article  g42g4h647-73tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0818367&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200502683naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450128001671000024002957000023003197000020003421100009003627100009003717100009003805201404003896500076017936500172018696510009020416530010020506530015020606550020020757730030020958560006021258560196021319030018023270818368  a200602       200511                        eng     aEP19525708  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aR2310aDid Fertility Go Up after the Oklahoma City Bombing?

Board of Education in 1954 and the German reunification in 1989) and natural disasters (e.g., Hurricane Hugo in 1989) can affect fertility. In our research, we addressed the question of whether the Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995, a man-made disaster, influenced fertility patterns in Oklahoma. We defined three theoretical orientations-replacement theory, community influence theory, and terror management theory-that motivate a general expectation of birth increases, with different predictions emerging from time and geographic considerations. We used two different empirical methodologies. First, we fitted dummy-variable regression models to monthly birth data from 1990 to 1999 in metropolitan counties. We used birth counts to frame the problem and general fertility rates to address the problem formally. These analyses were organized within two design structures: a control-group interrupted time-series design and a difference-in-differences design. In these analyses, Oklahoma County showed an interpretable, consistent, and significant increase in births. Second, we used graphical smoothing models to display these effects visually. In combination, these methods provide compelling support for a fertility response to the Oklahoma City bombing. Certain parts of each theory helped us organize and understand the pattern of results. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g42g4h675-92tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0818368&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200501942naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450066001671000017002331100009002505200889002596500066011486500053012146510018012676530011012856530031012966530019013276530011013466550020013577730031013778560006014088560196014149030018016100818369  a200602       200511                        eng     aEP19525709  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aJ2210aChanges in Women's Postmarital Employment in Japan and Taiwan10aYu, Wei-Hsin  aU TX  aResearch on female labor-force participation has not fully explained why economic development has different effects on married women's employment continuity across societies. I use life-history data from nationally representative samples of women in Japan and Taiwan to examine the divergence in women's patterns of labor-force exit in these two countries during the postwar period. The findings reveal that the effects of family demands, occupation, firm size, and employment sector on women's exit rates differed substantially between Japan and Taiwan. Taken together, these factors account for the different trends in married women's employment during this period. I argue that the cross-national differences in the predictors of women's labor-force withdrawal reflect the extent of incompatibility between work and family responsibilities for married women in these two societies. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22)  aJapan; Taiwan  aFemale  a Labor Force Participation  a Participation  a Women  aJournal Article  g42g4h693-717tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0818369&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200501652naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450092001591000026002511100034002775200731003116500038010426510009010806530014010896530013011036550020011167730030011368560006011668560196011729030018013680818370  a200602       200511                        eng     aEP19525710  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1210aFamilial Obesity as a Proxy for Omitted Variables in the Obesity-Mortality Relationship10aGronniger, J. Timothy  aUS Congressional Budge Office  aIn a conventional survival analysis of a sample of the U.S. population in 1971-1974, the association between mortality and obesity is compared with the analogous risk from the presence of an obese person in a household. The two factors have similar risk profiles, with a hazard ratio of 1.44 for nonmorbid obesity and 1.48 for nonmorbid familial obesity in one sample. If "familial obesity" cannot directly affect personal longevity, and if shared factors determine both personal and familial obesity, the mortality risk of family and actual personal obesity is similarly overstated. This false positive in the estimated risk arises from correlations among obesity and unobserved environmental, behavioral, or genetic factors. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aMortality  a Obesity  aJournal Article  g42g4h719-35tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0818370&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200502396naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001830430008001912450148001991000019003471100013003665200654003796500038010336500084010716500076011556500109012316500119013406500172014596510010016316530010016416530012016516530013016636530015016766530013016916550020017047730030017248560006017548560196017609030018019560818371  a200602       200511                        eng     aEP19525711  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ12  aJ13  aO15  aO18  aR2313aThe Influence of Network Mortality Experience on Nonnumeric Response Concerning Expected Family Size: Evidence from a Nepalese Mountain Village10aSandberg, John  aMcGill U  aThis article investigates the effects of sociometric network members' self-reported experiences with infant mortality on nonnumeric responses regarding expected family size among women in a small Nepalese community.

Parental mortality from all causes prior to and during follow-up increased the risk of a child moving by nearly two times after we controlled for the age and gender of the child and household characteristics. However, in the follow-up period, child mobility following maternal deaths from AIDS was lower than child mobility following maternal deaths from other causes. Younger children, boys, and children whose mothers or fathers were resident members of the children's households were also less likely to move. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aSouth Africa  aAIDS  a Aids  a Child  a Children  a Deaths  a Mortality  a Rural  aJournal Article  g42g4h757-68tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0818372&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200503103naa  2200505   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001830430008001910430008001992450121002071000018003287000018003467000020003647000020003841100023004047100015004277100041004427100044004835201097005276500044016246500117016686500077017856500065018626500109019276500119020366500098021556510011022536530014022646530013022786530021022916530015023126550020023277730030023478560006023778560196023839030018025790818373  a200602       200511                        eng     aEP19525713  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aF22  aI38  aJ11  aJ61  aO15  aO18  aZ1310aDo Conditional Cash Transfers Influence Migration?

We use experimental data from PROGRESA, Mexico's primary poverty-reduction program, to evaluate the effects of conditional cash transfers on migration both domestically and to the United States. Our study complements a growing body of literature aimed at overcoming longstanding hurdles to the establishment of causal validity in empirical studies of migration. Analysis based on the data collected before and after the program's onset shows that conditional transfers reduce U.S. migration but not domestic migration. The data also enable us to explore the role of existing family and community migration networks. The results show that migration networks strongly influence migration, but that the effect of conditional transfers on migration is apparently not mediated by existing migration network structures. Our results suggest that conditional transfers may be helpful in managing rural out-migration, particularly to the United States. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aEconomic Sociology; Economic Anthropology; Social and Economic Stratification         b(Z13)  aMexico  aMigration  a Poverty  a Social Networks  a Transfers  aJournal Article  g42g4h769-90tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0818373&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200502544naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450086001671000024002537000018002777000021002957000022003167000019003381100022003577100009003797100009003887100009003977100009004065201184004156500077015996500172016766510009018486530014018576530016018716550020018877730031019078560006019388560196019449030018021400818374  a200602       200511                        eng     aEP19525714  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aR2310aTemporal and Spatial Variation in Age-Specific Net Migration in the United States10aJohnson, Kenneth M.10aVoss, Paul R.10aHammer, Roger B.10aFuguitt, Glenn V.10aMcNiven, Scott  aLoyola U, Chicago  aU WI  aU WI  aU WI  aU WI  aAs fertility differences in the United States diminish, population redistribution trends are increasingly dependent on migration. This research used newly developed county-level age-specific net migration estimates for the 1990s, supplemented with longitudinal age-specific migration data spanning the prior 40 years, to ascertain whether there are clear longitudinal trends in age-specific net migration and to determine if there is spatial clustering in the migration patterns. The analysis confirmed the continuation into the 1990s of distinct net migration "signature patterns" for most types of counties, although there was temporal variation in the overall volume of migration across the five decades. A spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed large, geographically contiguous regions of net in-migration (in particular, Florida and the Southwest) and geographically contiguous regions of net out-migration (the Great Plains, in particular) that persisted over time. Yet the patterns of spatial concentration and fragmentation over time in these migration data demonstrate the relevance of this "neighborhood" approach to understanding spatiotemporal change in migration. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aMigration  a Population  aJournal Article  g42g4h791-812tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0818374&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200503376naa  2200529   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001830430008001910430008001992450089002071000024002967000020003201100050003407100026003905201364004166500038017806500048018186500076018666500066019426500109020086500119021176500172022366510009024086530013024176530018024306530026024486530024024746530012024986530022025106530010025326530013025426530011025556530011025666550020025777730031025978560006026288560196026349030016028300800461  a200511       200508                        eng     aEP18275794  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aI31  aJ13  aJ16  aO15  aO18  aR2310aUrban Poverty and Health in Developing Countries: Household and Neighborhood Effects10aMontgomery, Mark R.10aHewett, Paul C.  aU Stony Brook, SUNY and US Population Council  aUS Population Council  aIn the United States and other high-income countries, there is intense scholarly and programmatic interest in the effects of household and neighborhood living standards on health. Yet few studies of developing-country cities have explored these issues. We investigated whether the health of urban women and children in poor countries is influenced by both household and neighborhood standards of living. Using data from the urban samples of 85 Demographic and Health Surveys and modeling living standards using factor-analytic MIMIC methods, we found that the neighborhoods of relatively poor households are more heterogeneous than is often asserted. Our results indicated that poor urban households do not tend to live in uniformly poor neighborhoods: about 1 in 10 of a poor household's neighbors is relatively affluent, belonging to the upper quartile of the urban distribution of living standards. Do household and neighborhood living standards influence health? Using multivariate models, we found that household living standards are closely associated with three health measures: unmet need for modern contraception, attendance of a trained health care provider at childbirth, and young children's height for age. Neighborhood living standards exert a significant additional influence in many of the surveys we examined, especially for birth attendance. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aLDCs  aChildren  a Demographics  a Developing Countries  a Developing Country  a Health  a Living Standards  a Poor  a Poverty  a Urban  a Women  aJournal Article  g42g3h397-425tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0800461&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200501931naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450076001751000025002517000019002767000022002951100026003177100011003437100011003545200665003656500048010306500084010786500076011626510009012386530013012476530013012606530016012736550020012897730030013098560006013398560196013459030016015410800462  a200511       200508                        eng     aEP18275795  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI31  aJ12  aJ1310aParental Divorce and Subsequent Disadvantage: A Cross-Cohort Comparison20aSigle-Rushton, Wendy10aHobcraft, John10aKiernan, Kathleen  aLondon School of Econ  aU York  aU York  aAlthough many studies have examined the link between parental divorce and subsequent well-being, some theories of the effects of divorce suggest that the negative associations should have declined over time. However, few studies have examined the extent to which the associations have remained stable over time. Using data from two British cohorts, we analyzed both shorter- and longer-term outcomes of children who experienced parental divorce and the extent to which the associations have changed over time. Estimating similar models for both cohorts, we found little evidence of any change in the size of the relationship as divorce became more commonplace. 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.K.  aChildren  a Divorce  a Well Being  aJournal Article  g42g3h427-46tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0800462&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200502614naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450110001671000024002777000024003017000024003251100034003497100034003837100034004175201291004516500084017426500076018266510009019026530013019116530012019246530013019366530012019496530011019616550020019727730030019928560006020228560196020289030016022240800463  a200511       200508                        eng     aEP18275796  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1313aThe Impact of Family Structure Transitions on Youth Achievement: Evidence from the Children of the NLSY7910aAughinbaugh, Alison10aPierret, Charles R.10aRothstein, Donna S.  aUS Bureau of Labor Statistics  aUS Bureau of Labor Statistics  aUS Bureau of Labor Statistics  aWe investigated the sensitivity of measures of cognitive ability and socioemotional development to changes in parents' marital status using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979. We used several scores for each assessment, taken at different times relative to parents' marital transitions, which allowed us to trace the effects starting up to five years before a parent's change in marital status and continuing for up to six years afterward. It also allowed us to correct for the unobserved heterogeneity of the transition and nontransition samples by controlling for the child's fixed effect in estimating the time path of his or her response to the transition. We found that children from families with both biological parents scored significantly better on the BPI and the PIAT-math and PIAT-reading assessments than did children from nonintact families. However, much of the difference disappeared when we controlled for background variables. Furthermore, when we controlled for child fixed effects, we did not find significant longitudinal variation in these scores over long periods that encompass the marital transition. This finding suggests that most of the variation is due to cross-sectional differences and is not a result of marital transitions per se. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Family  a Marital  a Parent  a Youth  aJournal Article  g42g3h447-68tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0800463&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200502894naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450061001831000023002447000028002677000022002951100015003177100015003327100015003475201411003626500117017736500077018906500065019676500172020326510009022046530014022136530013022276550020022407730030022608560006022908560196022969030016024920800464  a200511       200508                        eng     aEP18275797  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI38  aJ11  aJ61  aR2310aWelfare Reform and Interstate Migration of Poor Families10aDe Jong, Gordon F.10aGraefe, Deborah Roempke10aSt. Pierre, Tanja  aPA State U  aPA State U  aPA State U  aThe thesis of this study is that as a result of increased inequalities in welfare rules, the 1996 welfare reform act not only enhanced incentives for poor families to move but also (and perhaps more important) created disincentives for them to stay in "race to the bottom" states. In testing this thesis, we evaluated the mediating and moderating roles of state economic development and family structure. We merged data from three main sources: the 1996-1999 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the Urban Institute's Welfare Rules Database, and state economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Modeling both destination (pull) and departure (push) effects of welfare policy measures and selected covariates in a nested discrete-time event-history migration analysis, we found robust support for the thesis that stringency in state welfare-eligibility and behavior-related rules stimulated interstate out-migration of poor families in the United States. However, poor families were not drawn to states with relatively more-lenient welfare rules, although stringency in state welfare dollar benefits inhibited inmigration and state unemployment patterns may have conditioned the migration effects of welfare-reform rules on the choice of destination. Single mothers were not more directly affected by welfare-eligibility and behavior-related rules than were poor married couples. 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aMigration  a Welfare  aJournal Article  g42g3h469-96tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0800464&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200502727naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450099001831000020002827000018003027000018003201100019003387100017003577100019003745201191003936500077015846500113016616500065017746500172018396510009020116530011020206530015020316530014020466550020020607730031020808560006021118560196021179030016023130800465  a200511       200508                        eng     aEP18275798  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ15  aJ61  aR2310aMigration and Spatial Assimilation among U.S. Latinos: Classical versus Segmented Trajectories10aSouth, Scott J.10aCrowder, Kyle10aChavez, Erick  aU Albany, SUNY  aWestern WA U  aU Albany, SUNY  aWe used merged data from the Latino National Political Survey, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and the U.S. census to examine patterns and determinants of interneighborhood residential mobility between 1990 and 1995 for 2,074 U.S. residents of Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban ethnicity. In several respects, our findings confirm the central tenets of spatial assimilation theory: Latino residential mobility into neighborhoods that are inhabited by greater percentages of non-Hispanic whites (i.e., Anglos) increases with human and financial capital and English-language use. However, these results also point to variations in the residential mobility process among Latinos that are broadly consistent with the segmented assimilation perspective on ethnic and immigrant incorporation. Net of controls, Puerto Ricans are less likely than Mexicans to move to neighborhoods with relatively large Anglo populations, and the generational and socioeconomic differences that are anticipated by the classical assimilation model emerge more strongly for Mexicans than for Puerto Ricans or Cubans. Among Puerto Ricans and Cubans, darker skin color inhibits mobility into Anglo neighborhoods. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Migration  a Mobility  aJournal Article  g42g3h497-521tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0800465&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200501840naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450089001671000021002567000024002777000022003011100019003237100015003427100015003575200721003726500066010936500065011596510009012246530013012336550020012467730030012668560006012968560196013029030016014980800466  a200511       200508                        eng     aEP18275799  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aJ3110aWives Who Outearn Their Husbands: A Transitory or Persistent Phenomenon for Couples?10aWinkler, Anne E.10aMcBride, Timothy D.10aAndrews, Courtney  aU MO, St Louis  aSt Louis U  aSt Louis U  aIn what percentage of married couples do wives outearn their husbands, and, moreover, how persistent are these patterns?

We develop EB methods that treat schedules as vectors and use adaptive neighborhoods to keep estimates appropriately local. This method estimates demographic rates for local subpopulations by borrowing strength not only from similar individuals elsewhere but also from other groups in the same area and from regularities in schedules across locations. EB is substantially better than standard methods when rates have strong spatial and age patterns. We illustrate this method with estimates of age-specific fertility schedules for over 3,800 Brazilian municipalities. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aBrazil  aDemographics  aJournal Article  g42g3h537-58tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0800467&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200502077naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450078001751000019002537000026002727000017002981100091003157100014004067100021004205200701004416500077011426500084012196500123013036510020014266530013014466550020014597730030014798560006015098560196015159030016017110800468  a200511       200508                        eng     aEP18275801  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ12  aP2311aAggregate Age-at-Marriage Patterns from Individual Mate-Search Heuristics10aTodd, Peter M.10aBillari, Francesco C.10aSimao, Jorge  aCenter for Adoptive Behavior and Cognition, Max Planck Institute for Human Development  aBocconi U  aFCT/New U Lisbon  aThe distribution of age at first marriage shows well-known strong regularities across many countries and recent historical periods. We accounted for these patterns by developing agent-based models that simulate the aggregate behavior of individuals who are searching for marriage partners. Past models assumed fully rational agents with complete knowledge of the marriage market; our simulated agents used psychologically plausible simple heuristic mate search rules that adjust aspiration levels on the basis of a sequence of encounters with potential partners. Substantial individual variation must be included in the models to account for the demographically observed age-at-marriage patterns. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population         b(P23)  aNorway; Romania  aMarriage  aJournal Article  g42g3h559-74tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0800468&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200501834naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450099001671000012002667000016002781100053002947100019003475200718003666500038010846500077011226510023011996530014012226530016012366550020012527730030012728560006013028560196013089030016015040800469  a200511       200508                        eng     aEP18275802  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1110aCoherent Mortality Forecasts for a Group of Populations: An Extension of the Lee-Carter Method10aLi, Nan10aLee, Ronald  aTerry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, Duke U  aU CA, Berkeley  aMortality patterns and trajectories in closely related populations are likely to be similar in some respects, and differences are unlikely to increase in the long run. It should therefore be possible to improve the mortality forecasts for individual countries by taking into account the patterns in a larger group. Using the Human Mortality Database, we apply the Lee-Carter model to a group of populations, allowing each its own age pattern and level of mortality but imposing shared rates of change by age. Our forecasts also allow divergent patterns to continue for a while before tapering off. We forecast greater longevity gains for the United States and lesser ones for Japan relative to separate forecasts. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aSelected Countries  aMortality  a Population  aJournal Article  g42g3h575-94tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0800469&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200502282naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450047001671000015002147000022002291100049002517100049003005201164003496500038015136500066015516510009016176530011016266530015016376530015016526530011016676550020016787730031016988560006017298560196017359030013019310788714  a200508       200505                        eng     aEP17224789  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1610aSex Differences in Morbidity and Mortality10aCase, Anne10aPaxson, Christina  aCenter for Health and Wellbeing, Princeton U  aCenter for Health and Wellbeing, Princeton U  aWomen have worse self-rated health and more hospitalization episodes than men from early adolescence to late middle age, but are less likely to die at each age. We use 14 years of data from the U.S. National Health Interview Survey to examine this paradox. Our results indicate that the difference in self-assessed health between women and men can be entirely explained by differences in the distribution of the chronic conditions they face. This is not true, however, for hospital episodes and mortality. Men with several smoking-related conditions--including cardiovascular disease and certain lung disorders--are more likely to experience hospital episodes and to die than women who suffer from the same chronic conditions, implying that men may experience more-severe forms of these conditions. While some of the difference in mortality can be explained by differences in the distribution of chronic conditions, an equally large share can be attributed to the larger adverse effects of these conditions on male mortality. The greater effects of smoking-related conditions on men's health may be due to their higher rates of smoking throughout their lives. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aHealth  a Morbidity  a Mortality  a Women  aJournal Article  g42g2h189-214tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788714&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200502783naa  2200529   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001830430008001912450081001991000031002807000018003117000023003297000023003521100044003757100017004197100009004367100015004455200750004606500077012106500084012876500113013716500066014846500166015506500163017166510009018796530011018886530012018996530013019116530014019246530013019386530015019516530010019666530012019766550020019887730030020088560006020388560196020449030013022400788715  a200508       200505                        eng     aEP17224790  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ12  aJ15  aJ16  aN31  aN3210aRace, Gender, and Marriage: Destination Selection during the Great Migration10aWhite, Katherine J.

Gender differences were largely dependent on marital status. Consistent with the "tied-migration" thesis, married women had destination outcomes that were similar to those of men, whereas single women had a greater propensity to reside in metropolitan locations where economic opportunities for women were more plentiful. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Gender  a Marital  a Marriage  a Migrant  a Migration  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g42g2h215-41tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788715&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200502125naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450104001671000026002717000023002977000025003207000023003451100032003687100032004007100039004327100025004715200778004966500077012746500109013516510014014606530012014746530012014866550020014987730030015188560006015488560196015549030013017500788716  a200508       200505                        eng     aEP17224791  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aO1510aThree Dimensions of the Survival Curve: Horizontalization, Verticalization, and Longevity Extension10aCheung, Siu Lan Karen10aRobine, Jean-Marie10aTu, Edward Jow-Ching10aCaselli, Graziella  aINSERM/Demographie et Sante  aINSERM/Demographie et Sante  aHong Kong U Science and Technology  aU Rome 'La Sapienza'  aThree dimensions of the survival curve have been developed: (1) "horizontalization," which corresponds to how long a cohort and how many survivors can live before aging-related deaths significantly decrease the proportion of survivors; (2) "verticalization," which corresponds to how concentrated aging-related ("normal") deaths are around the modal age at death (M); and (3) "longevity extension," which corresponds to how far the highest normal life durations can exceed M. Our study shows that the degree of horizontalization increased relatively less than the degree of verticalization in Hong Kong from 1976 to 2001. After age normalization, the highest normal life durations moved closer to M, implying that the increase in human longevity is meeting some resistance. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aHong Kong  aCohorts  a Deaths  aJournal Article  g42g2h243-58tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788716&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200501815naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450077001751000021002521100019002735200668002926500077009606500076010376500066011136510009011796530010011886530015011986530011012136550020012247730030012448560006012748560196012809030013014760788717  a200508       200505                        eng     aEP17224792  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ13  aJ1613aThe Age Pattern of First-Birth Rates among U.S. Women: The Bimodal 1990s10aSullivan, Rachel  aU CA, Berkeley  aBetween 1990 and 2002, the age pattern of Type I first-birth rates (i.e., the hazard of a first birth) among U.S. women was bimodal. This pattern, driven by changing differential fertility patterns among racial and ethnic groups, reached its apex at the mid-1990s and had almost vanished by the decade's end. Research on first-birth timing has tended to focus on Type II first-birth rates and therefore has failed to identify this larger, bimodal pattern. This article presents the benefits of using Type I rates, documents the emergence of the bimodal pattern via two new measures of bimodality, and uses a decomposition analysis to discuss the pattern's causes. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Fertility  a Women  aJournal Article  g42g2h259-73tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788717&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200502171naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450140001831000018003231100009003415200717003506500042010676500066011096500109011756500155012846510010014396530016014496530012014656530025014776530019015026530011015216550020015327730030015528560006015828560196015889030013017840788718  a200508       200505                        eng     aEP17224793  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ16  aO15  aP3610aMarket Transition, Educational Disparities, and Family Strategies in Rural China: New Evidence on Gender Stratification and Development10aHannum, Emily  aU PA  aTwo theoretical perspectives have dominated debates about the impact of development on gender stratification: modernization theory, which argues that gender inequalities decline with economic growth, and the "women in development" perspective, which argues that development may initially widen gender gaps.

In this article, we focus on how two social and economic crises--the Great Leap Forward famine and the Cultural Revolution--resulted in elevated risks of miscarriage and stillbirth in the Chinese population. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36)  aChina  aDemographics  a Famine  a Mothers  a Pregnancy  aJournal Article  g42g2h301-22tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788719&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200502193naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450071001751000029002467000018002751100014002937100023003075200896003306500084012266500113013106500155014236510011015786530013015896550020016027730030016228560006016528560196016589030013018540788720  a200508       200505                        eng     aEP17224795  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ15  aP3610aEthnic Intermarriage in Times of Social Change: The Case of Latvia10aMonden, Christiaan W.

Before independence, ethnic intermarriage was already rather common, involving about 17% of the marriages annually. Since independence, intermarriage between Russians and Latvians has increased substantially. Part of this increase can be explained by selective emigration, but at least half of it may be due to integrative processes. Although there were more marriages between Russian men and Latvian women before independence, the gender pattern reversed after independence. Intermarriage levels were the highest among the less educated, children of mixed couples, partners with similar educational levels, and people in the countryside. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Consumer Economics; Health; Education and Training: Welfare, Income, Wealth, and Poverty         b(P36)  aLatvia  aMarriage  aJournal Article  g42g2h323-45tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788720&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200502303naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450057001751000023002327000023002557000021002781100011002997100043003107100009003535201020003626500077013826500066014596500109015256510017016346530014016516530011016656550020016767730030016968560006017268560196017329030013019280788721  a200508       200505                        eng     aEP17224796  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ16  aO1510aMigration and Relationship Power among Mexican Women10aParrado, Emilio A.10aFlippen, Chenoa A.10aMcQuiston, Chris  aDuke U  aCenter for Demographic Studies, Duke U  aU NC  aOur study drew on original data collected in Durham, NC, and four sending communities in Mexico to examine differences in women's relationship power that are associated with migration and residence in the United States. We analyzed the personal, relationship, and social resources that condition the association between migration and women's power and the usefulness of the Relationship Control Scale (RCS) for capturing these effects. We found support for perspectives that emphasize that migration may simultaneously mitigate and reinforce gender inequities. Relative to their nonmigrant peers, Mexican women in the United States average higher emotional consonance with their partners, but lower relationship control and sexual negotiation power. Methodologically, we found that the RCS is internally valid and useful for measuring the impact of resources on women's power. However, the scale appears to combine diverse dimensions of relationship power that were differentially related to migration in our study. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMexico; U.S.  aMigration  a Women  aJournal Article  g42g2h347-72tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788721&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200502233naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450071001751000018002467000018002647000018002827000027003001100009003277100009003367100009003457100009003545200919003636500059012826500084013416500076014256510009015016530010015106530014015206530012015346530012015466550020015587730030015788560006016088560196016149030013018100788722  a200508       200505                        eng     aEP17224797  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD12  aJ12  aJ1310aBy What Measure?

Three separate problems are evident. First, the conventional focus on explicit activities with children distracts attention from the larger responsibilities of "passive" care, which ranges from time when children are sleeping to time when they are in the same general area but are not engaged in an activity with parents. Second, the empirical analysis of activity time focuses almost exclusively on parents, overlooking the role of relatives such as grandmothers and siblings. Third, the measurement of active care time often ignores the impact of overlaps among both care providers and recipients. Our analysis of the Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics sheds light on these three problems and presents new measures of passive and active care time. 4aConsumer Economics: Empirical Analysis         b(D12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Family  a Parent  aJournal Article  g42g2h373-90tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788722&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200501773naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450058001671000022002257000024002471100013002717100009002845200631002936500084009246500076010086510009010846530010010936530014011036530016011176530013011336530012011466550020011587730030011788560006012088560196012149030013014100788723  a200508       200505                        eng     aEP17224798  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aChanges in Children's Time with Parents: A Correction10aSandberg, John F.10aHofferth, Sandra L.  aMcGill U  aU MD  aThis article provides corrected estimates of the weekly time that 3- to 12-year-old children spent either directly engaged with their parents or with their parents accessible to them in 1997, replicating the figures presented in the original 2001 Demography article.

This decline coincided with an epidemiological transition and the disappearance of a mortality "penalty" associated with living in urban areas. There is little empirical evidence and much unresolved debate about what caused these improvements, however. In this article, we report the causal influence of clean water technologies--filtration and chlorination--on mortality in major cities during the early twentieth century. Plausibly exogenous variation in the timing and location of technology adoption was used to identify these effects, and the validity of this identifying assumption is examined in detail. We found that clean water was responsible for nearly half the total mortality reduction in major cities, three quarters of the infant mortality reduction, and nearly two thirds of the child mortality reduction. Rough calculations suggest that the social rate of return to these technologies was greater than 23 to 1, with a cost per person-year saved by clean water of about $500 in 2003 dollars. Implications for developing countries are briefly considered. 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18)  aU.S.  aHealth  a Public Health  aJournal Article  g42g1h1-22tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0772623&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200501628naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450072001671000020002391100033002595200622002926500059009146500038009736510023010116530020010346530015010546550020010697730029010898560006011188560196011249030018013200772624  a200505       200502                        eng     aEP16375978  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aC53  aI1210aLong-Range Trends in Adult Mortality: Models and Projection Methods10aBongaarts, John  aPopulation Council, New York  aIn the study reported here, I had two objectives: (1) to test a new version of the logistic model for the pattern of change over time in age-specific adult mortality rates and (2) to develop a new method for projecting future trends in adult mortality. A test of the goodness of fit of the logistic model for the force of mortality indicated that its slope parameter is nearly constant over time. This finding suggests a variant of the model that is called the shifting logistic model. A new projection method, based on the shifting mortality model, is proposed and compared with the widely used Lee-Carter procedure. 4aForecasting Models; Simulation Methods         b(C53) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aSelected Countries  aMortality Rates  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g42g1h23-49tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0772624&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200502287naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450137001751000018003127000020003307000021003507000021003717000021003921100019004137100019004327100020004517100014004717100019004855200757005046500056012616500113013176500172014306510009016026530009016116550020016207730029016408560006016698560196016759030018018710772625  a200505       200502                        eng     aEP16375979  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI32  aJ15  aR2310aFifteen Years Later: Can Residential Mobility Programs Provide a Long-Term Escape from Neighborhood Segregation, Crime, and Poverty?10aKeels, Micere10aDuncan, Greg J.10aDeLuca, Stefanie10aMendenhall, Ruby10aRosenbaum, James  aNorthwestern U  aNorthwestern U  aJohns Hopkins U  aU Chicago  aNorthwestern U  aWe examined whether the Gautreaux residential mobility program, which moved poor black volunteer families who were living in inner-city Chicago into more-affluent and integrated neighborhoods, produced long-run improvements in the neighborhood environments of the participants.

Families who were placed in higher-income, mostly white neighborhoods were currently living in the most-affluent neighborhoods. Families who were placed in lower-crime and suburban locations were most likely to reside in low-crime neighborhoods years later. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aPoor  aJournal Article  g42g1h51-73tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0772625&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200501980naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450099001671000022002667000022002881100016003107100016003265200832003426500076011746500113012506510009013636530013013726530012013856550020013977730029014178560006014468560196014529030018016480772626  a200505       200502                        eng     aEP16375980  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1510aUnderstanding Racial Differences in the Economic Costs of Growing Up in a Single-Parent Family10aPage, Marianne E.10aStevens, Ann Huff  aU CA, Davis  aU CA, Davis  aThis article examines whether the economic consequences of growing up in a single-parent family differ for black children and white children. It is important to understand whether the costs differ across racial groups because although much of the rhetoric about poor single-parent families focuses on inner-city blacks, most children who live in such families are white. If the costs of living with only one parent vary across groups, then policies that are aimed at reducing the costs that do not acknowledge this variation will not target resources efficiently. We found that the economic costs of living with a single parent are larger for black children than for white children. Most of the discrepancy can be attributed to differences in remarriage rates, marital stability, welfare participation, and female labor supply. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Racial  aJournal Article  g42g1h75-90tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0772626&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200502021naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450075001671000020002421100020002625201114002826500050013966500051014466550020014977730030015178560006015478560196015539030018017490772627  a200505       200502                        eng     aEP16375981  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aC50  aJ1010aRemarks on the Analysis of Causal Relationships in Population Research10aMoffitt, Robert  aJohns Hopkins U  aThe problem of determining cause and effect is one of the oldest in the social sciences, where laboratory experimentation is generally not possible. This article provides a perspective on the analysis of causal relationships in population research that draws upon recent discussions of this issue in the field of economics. Within economics, thinking about causal estimation has shifted dramatically in the past decade toward a more pessimistic reading of what is possible and a retreat in the ambitiousness of claims of causal determination. In this article, the framework that underlies this conclusion is presented, the central identification problem is discussed in detail, and examples from the field of population research are given. Some of the more important aspects of this framework are related to the problem of the variability of causal effects for different individuals; the relationships among structural forms, reduced forms, and knowledge of mechanisms; the problem of internal versus external validity and the related issue of extrapolation; and the importance of theory and outside evidence. 4aEconometric Modeling: General         b(C50) 4aDemographic Economics: General         b(J10)  aJournal Article  g42g1h91-108tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0772627&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200502102naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450053001831000027002367000019002637000019002821100009003017100009003107100009003195200721003286500038010496500118010876500109012056500067013146510014013816530011013956530012014066530016014186550020014347730030014548560006014848560196014909030018016860772628  a200505       200502                        eng     aEP16375982  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aO13  aO15  aQ2310aHealth Consequences of Forest Fires in Indonesia10aFrankenberg, Elizabeth10aMcKee, Douglas10aThomas, Duncan  aUCLA  aUCLA  aUCLA  aWe combined data from a population-based longitudinal survey with satellite measures of aerosol levels to assess the impact of smoke from forest fires that blanketed the Indonesian islands of Kalimantan and Sumatra in late 1997 on adult health.

Between 1993 and 1997, individuals who were exposed to haze experienced greater increases in difficulty with activities of daily living than did their counterparts in nonhaze areas. The results for respiratory and general health, although more complicated to interpret, suggest that haze had a negative impact on these dimensions of health. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomic Development: Agriculture; Natural Resources; Energy; Environment; Other Primary Products         b(O13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aRenewable Resources and Conservation: Forestry         b(Q23)  aIndonesia  aForest  a Health  a Population  aJournal Article  g42g1h109-29tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0772628&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200501829naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450097001671000023002641100017002875200793003046500042010976500065011396510009012046530014012136530017012276530013012446550020012577730030012778560006013078560196013139030018015090772629  a200505       200502                        eng     aEP16375983  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ6110aEducational Selectivity in U.S. Immigration: How Do Immigrants Compare to Those Left Behind?10aFeliciano, Cynthia  aU CA, Irvine  aCurrent immigration research has revealed little about how immigrants compare to those who do not migrate. Although most scholars agree that migrants are not random samples of their home countries' populations, the direction and degree of educational selectivity is not fully understood. This study of 32 U.S. immigrant groups found that although nearly all immigrants are more educated than those who remain in their home countries, immigrants vary substantially in their degree of selectivity, depending upon the origin country and the timing of migration. Uncovering patterns of immigrant selectivity reveals the fallacy in attributing immigrants' characteristics to national groups as a whole and may help explain socioeconomic differences among immigrant groups in the United States. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  a Immigration  a Migrant  aJournal Article  g42g1h131-52tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0772629&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200502007naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450075001751000022002507000018002721100020002907100019003105200787003296500042011166500083011586500065012416510009013066530014013156530015013296530016013446530015013606550020013757730030013958560006014258560196014319030018016270772630  a200505       200502                        eng     aEP16375984  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ24  aJ6113aThe Importance of Education-Occupation Matching in Migration Decisions10aQuinn, Michael A.10aRubb, Stephen  aBentley College  aSacred Heart U  aIn this article, we present and test a model that incorporates education-occupation matching into the migration decision. The literature on education-occupation matching shows that earnings are affected by how individuals' education matches that required by their occupation. Accordingly, individuals with more schooling than required by their occupation have an additional incentive to migrate: the increase in earnings that occurs with a more beneficial education-occupation match. Using data from Mexico, we found statistical support for the importance of education-occupation matching in migration decisions. Education-occupation matching provides a plausible explanation for the mixed findings in the literature on the relationship between educational attainment and migration. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aEducation  a Migration  a Occupation  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g42g1h153-67tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0772630&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200501970naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450077001751000022002527000020002741100012002947100020003065200735003266500038010616500108010996500109012076510019013166530015013356530012013506550020013627730030013828560006014128560196014189030018016140772631  a200505       200502                        eng     aEP16375985  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ14  aO1510aDifferences in Disability among Older Women and Men in Egypt and Tunisia10aYount, Kathryn M.10aAgree, Emily M.  aEmory U  aJohns Hopkins U  aResearch on child survival and health has indicated disparities between boys and girls in selected Middle Eastern countries.

Whereas children who were born to the most-educated women are gaining resources, in terms of parents' time and money, those who were born to the least-educated women are losing resources. The forces behind these changes include feminism, new birth control technologies, changes in labor market opportunities, and welfare-state policies. I contend that Americans should be concerned about the growing disparity in parental resources and that the government can do more to close the gap between rich and poor children. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aSelected Countries  aBirth  a Children  a Demographics  a Parent  a Welfare  aJournal Article  g41g4h607-27tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788704&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200402530naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450121001831000018003047000020003221100018003427100009003605201098003696500056014676500077015236500084016006500081016846510009017656530013017746530012017876530032017996530012018316530019018436550020018627730030018828560006019128560196019189030018021140788705  a200508       200411                        eng     aEP15313908  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI32  aJ11  aJ12  aJ6210aFamily Structure, Intergenerational Mobility, and the Reproduction of Poverty: Evidence for Increasing Polarization?10aMusick, Kelly10aMare, Robert D.  aU Southern CA  aUCLA  aA substantial body of research has demonstrated links between poverty and family structure from one generation to the next, but has left open key questions about the implications of these associations for aggregate-level change. To what extent does intergenerational inheritance affect trends in poverty and single parenthood over time and, in particular, trends in the relative economic positions of single-parent and two-parent families? This article examines how patterns of intergenerational inheritance play out in the population over the long run, using data from the National Longitudinal Surveys and a model of population renewal that takes into account intergenerational mobility and differential fertility across groups that are defined by poverty status and family structure. Our results suggest that current rates of intergenerational inheritance have little effect on population change over time. They account for only a small share of the recent historical change in poverty and family structure and play no role in exacerbating existing economic disparities by family structure. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aJob, Occupational, and Intergenerational Mobility; Promotion         b(J62)  aU.S.  aFamilies  a Family  a Intergenerational Mobility  a Parent  a Single Parent  aJournal Article  g41g4h629-48tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788705&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200402730naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001830430008001912450070001991000023002697000020002927000028003121100026003407100026003667100014003925201159004066500044015656500056016096500077016656500076017426500083018186500065019016510009019666530010019756530014019856530015019996550020020147730030020348560006020648560196020709030018022660788706  a200508       200411                        eng     aEP15313909  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aF22  aI32  aJ11  aJ13  aJ24  aJ6111aA Decomposition of Trends in Poverty among Children of Immigrants10aVan Hook, Jennifer10aBrown, Susan L.10aKwenda, Maxwell Ndigume  aBowling Green State U  aBowling Green State U  aCameron U  aPoverty levels among all children in the United States have tended to fluctuate in the past 30 years. However, among the children of immigrants, child poverty increased steadily and rapidly from about 12% in 1970 to 33% in the late 1990s before declining to about 21% in 2000. Using 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 Public Use Microdata Samples data, we identified key factors that underlie the fluctuations in immigrant child poverty from 1969 to 1999 and the divergence from children of natives. We found that roughly half the absolute increase in immigrant child poverty can be linked to changing conditions in the U.S. economy that make it more difficult to lift a family out of poverty than 30 years ago. These changes occurred disproportionately among children of parents with lower levels of education, employment, and U.S. experience but not among racial/ethnic minorities. Poverty risks among various racial and ethnic groups converged over time. The relative increase in poverty for immigrant versus native children owes largely to the divergence between immigrant and native families in racial/ethnic composition, parental education, and employment. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Immigrant  aJournal Article  g41g4h649-70tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788706&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200402521naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450120001751000022002957000022003171100009003397100029003485201219003776500042015966500084016386500076017226510009017986530013018076530014018206530012018346530012018466530019018586550020018777730030018978560006019278560196019339030018021290788707  a200508       200411                        eng     aEP15313910  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ12  aJ1310aFamily Structure and Children's Educational Outcomes: Blended Families, Stylized Facts, and Descriptive Regressions10aGinther, Donna K.10aPollak, Robert A.  aU KS  aWashington U in St Louis  aThis article adds to the growing literature describing correlations between children's educational outcomes and family structure. Popular discussions have focused on the distinction between two-parent families and single-parent families. This article shows that educational outcomes for both types of children in blended families--stepchildren and their half-siblings who are the joint children of both parents--are similar to each other and substantially worse than outcomes for children reared in traditional nuclear families. We conclude that as a description of the data, the crucial distinction is between children reared in traditional nuclear families (i.e., families in which all children are the joint children of both parents) and children reared in other family structures (e.g., single-parent families or blended families). We then turn from "stylized facts" (i.e., simple correlations) that control only for family structure to "descriptive regressions" that control for other variables such as family income. When controls for other variables are introduced, the relationship between family structure and children's educational outcomes weakens substantially and is often statistically insignificant. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Families  a Family  a Parent  a Single Parent  aJournal Article  g41g4h671-96tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788707&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200402651naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450084001751000029002597000020002887000024003081100015003327100020003477100015003675201216003826500076015986500113016746500172017876510009019596530015019686530012019836530011019956550020020067730031020268560006020578560196020639030018022590788708  a200508       200411                        eng     aEP15313911  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ15  aR2310aNeighborhood Context and Racial Differences in Early Adolescent Sexual Activity10aBrowning, Christopher R.10aLeventhal, Tama20aBrooks-Gunn, Jeanne  aOH State U  aJohns Hopkins U  aColumbia U  aEvidence suggests that African American youths initiate sexual activity at earlier ages than do European American or Latino youths. Using data from a multilevel study in Chicago, we developed and tested a neighborhood-based model of the timing of first adolescent intercourse that emphasizes the impact of neighborhood structural disadvantage and collective efficacy on early sexual activity (at ages 11 to 16). In turn, we explored the extent to which neighborhood factors account for racial differences in the timing of first intercourse. The findings indicate that demographic background, family processes, peer influences, and developmental risk factors account for about 30% of the baseline increased likelihood of early sexual onset for African American youths compared with European American youths. However, a significant residual racial difference remained even after we considered a host of micro-level factors. Neighborhood-level concentrated poverty largely explained this residual racial difference. Collective efficacy also independently contributed to the delay of sexual onset. No significant baseline difference in age of sexual initiation was found between Latino and European American youths. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aAdolescent  a Racial  a Youth  aJournal Article  g41g4h697-720tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788708&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200401739naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450091001751000020002667000023002861100009003097100016003185200576003346500044009106500077009546500065010316510009010966530011011056530015011166550020011317730030011518560006011818560196011879030018013830788709  a200508       200411                        eng     aEP15313912  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aF22  aJ11  aJ6110aComing to Stay: An Analysis of the U.S. Census Question on Immigrants' Year of Arrival10aRedstone, Ilana10aMassey, Douglas S.  aU PA  aPrinceton U  aUsing the New Immigrant Survey Pilot, we compare answers to the census question on year of arrival in the United States with answers to questions about the dates and durations of earlier U.S. trips.

This article explores altruistic and contractual patterns of remittances using a gendered approach. On the basis of results with various levels of significance in regression models, male and female migrants from Nang Rong, Thailand, behave both altruistically and contractually. However, women and migrants from poorer households behave more altruistically, while men and migrants from richer households behave more contractually. These results point to the need for further research and theory development to explain heterogeneities in migrants' behavior. 4aAltruism; Philanthropy         b(D64) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18)  aThailand  aFemale  a Migrant  a Rural  a Women  aJournal Article  g41g4h739-56tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788710&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200402055naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450088001751000020002637000020002831100082003037100067003855200692004526500038011446500077011826500109012596510023013686530017013916530012014086530015014206550020014357730030014558560006014858560196014919030018016870788711  a200508       200411                        eng     aEP15313914  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ11  aO1511aAdult Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa: Evidence from Demographic and Health Surveys10aTimaeus, Ian M.10aJasseh, Momodou  aCentre for Population Studies, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  aFarafenni Field Station, Medical Research Council Laboratories  aThis article reports levels, trends, and age patterns of adult mortality in 23 sub-Saharan Africa countries, based on the sibling histories and orphanhood data collected by the countries' Demographic and Health Surveys. Adult mortality has risen sharply since HIV became prevalent, but the size and speed of the mortality increase varies greatly among countries. Excess mortality is concentrated among women aged 25-39 and among men aged 30-44. These data suggest that the increase in the number of men who die each year has exceeded somewhat the increase for women. It is time for a systematic attempt to reconcile the demographic and epidemiological evidence concerning AIDS in Africa. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aSub-Saharan Africa  aDemographics  a Health  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g41g4h757-72tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788711&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200402614naa  2200469   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450104001831000023002877000020003107000022003307000021003521100037003737100009004107100009004197100009004285201022004376500038014596500077014976500076015746500113016506510009017636530012017726530012017846530016017966530013018126530021018256530015018466530012018616550020018737730031018938560006019248560196019309030018021260788712  a200508       200411                        eng     aEP15313915  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ11  aJ13  aJ1513aThe Increasing Racial Disparity in Infant Mortality: Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Other Causes10aFrisbie, W.

The objective of our analysis was to gain insight into the reasons for this growing inequality on the basis of data from linked cohort files for 1989-1990 and 1995-1998. We found a nationwide reversal from a survival advantage to a survival disadvantage for blacks with respect to respiratory distress syndrome over this period. The results are consistent with the view that the potential for a widening of the relative racial gap in infant mortality is high when innovations in health care occur in a continuing context of social inequality. As expected, the results for other causes of infant mortality, although similar, are less striking. Models of absolute change demonstrate that among low-weight births, absolute declines in mortality were greater for white infants than for black infants. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aCohorts  a Deaths  a Inequality  a Infants  a Mortality Rates  a Mortality  a Racial  aJournal Article  g41g4h773-800tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788712&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200402591naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450062001751000019002371100015002565201334002716500077016056500076016826500163017586510029019216530017019506530013019676530015019806550020019957730030020158560006020458560196020519030018022470788713  a200508       200411                        eng     aEP15313916  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ13  aN3210aTiming Effects and the Interpretation of Period Fertility10aSchoen, Robert  aPA State U  aLow fertility levels and later childbearing in many developed countries have reinvigorated the debate between period and cohort perspectives on fertility and on the meaningfulness of the period total fertility rate (TFR). Here, fertility-timing effects are defined as level changes in period fertility that do not reflect level changes in the completed fertility of cohorts. That definition leads to the average cohort fertility (ACF) as a measure of period fertility adjusted for timing effects. In an influential paper, Bongaarts and Feeney (1998) presented an alternative approach and a different measure, TFR*, to adjust for timing effects. Here, the two measures are compared. In the context of model populations, the ACF performs well, reflecting an average of the fertility of the active cohorts. The Bongaarts--Feeney TFR, however, is frequently unreliable and can be erratic when there are cycles in period timing. When applied to twentieth-century U.S. experience, the TFR* behaves like a period measure and yields adjustments that are often wide of the mark. The ACF shows the stability associated with cohort measures and quantifies the substantial impact that timing effects had during the "birth dearth" of the 1970s. The period TFR reached a low of 1.74 in 1976, but the ACF never went below 2.06 during the 1970s. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32)  aSelected Countries; U.S.  aChildbearing  a Cohorts  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g41g4h801-19tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788713&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200401939naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450068001751000021002437000021002641100044002857100059003295200678003886500038010666500077011046500113011816510009012946530014013036530015013176550020013327730031013528560006013838560196013899030016015850788694  a200508       200408                        eng     aEP14421226  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ11  aJ1510aParadox Lost: Explaining the Hispanic Adult Mortality Advantage10aPalloni, Alberto10aArias, Elizabeth  aCenter for Demography and Ecology, U WI  aNational Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, MD  aWe tested three competing hypotheses regarding the adult "Hispanic mortality paradox": data artifact, migration, and cultural or social buffering effects.

Our analysis suggests that the foreign-born Mexican advantage can be attributed to return migration, or the "salmon-bias" effect.

The 12-person panel prepared estimates from five national data sets and investigated methodological sources of the inconsistencies among the population aged 70 and older from the early 1980s to 2001. Although the evidence was mixed for the 1980s and it is difficult to pinpoint when in the 1990s the decline began, during the mid- and late 1990s, the panel found consistent declines on the order of 1%-2.5% per year for two commonly used measures in the disability literature: difficulty with daily activities and help with daily activities. Mixed evidence was found for a third measure: the use of help or equipment with daily activities. The panel also found agreement across surveys that the proportion of older persons who receive help with bathing has declined at the same time as the proportion who use only equipment (but not personal care) to bathe has increased. In comparing findings across surveys, the panel found that the period, definition of disability, treatment of the institutionalized population, and age standardizing of results were important to consider. The implications of the findings for policy, national survey efforts, and further research are discussed. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aDisability  a Old Age  aJournal Article  g41g3h417-41tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788695&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200402008naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450127001751000020003021100039003225200687003616500038010486500076010866500109011626510011012716530010012826530026012926530017013186530015013356530015013506530013013656550020013787730030013988560006014288560196014349030016016300788696  a200508       200408                        eng     aEP14421228  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aO1510aTrends in Socioeconomic Inequalities in Mortality in Developing Countries: The Case of Child Survival in Sao Paulo, Brazil10aSastry, Narayan  aRAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA  aI examined trends in socioeconomic inequalities in under-five mortality for the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, over a 21-year period from 1970 to 1991, during which much of the mortality transition unfolded.

Mother's education emerged as the key factor underlying socioeconomic inequalities in under-five mortality even as levels of education for women increased and inequality in schooling fell. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBrazil  aChild  a Developing Countries  a Development  a Education  a Mortality  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g41g3h443-64tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788696&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200401995naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450086001831000018002691100020002875200698003076500038010056500084010436500066011276500109011936510011013026530012013136530014013256530015013396530011013546550020013657730030013858560006014158560196014219030016016170788697  a200508       200408                        eng     aEP14421229  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ12  aJ16  aO1510aHIV Status and Union Dissolution in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Case of Rakai, Uganda10aPorter, Laura  aJohns Hopkins U  aLittle is known about the impact of HIV infection on the disruption of families through separation, divorce, and widowhood. Using life tables and multinomial logistic regression, this research examined the influence of HIV status on the risk of separation or divorce and widowhood among women in Rakai, Uganda. The multivariate results revealed that dissolution is more common among HIV-infected women and that infected women in HIV-discordant couples are especially likely to face separation or divorce than women in other HIV-status couples. These results highlight women's vulnerability to the social impact of HIV infection and the importance of dyadic studies of the disruption of unions. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aUganda  aDivorce  a Families  a Infection  a Women  aJournal Article  g41g3h465-82tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788697&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200402124naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450070001831000015002537000022002687000024002901100049003147100049003637100049004125200688004616500042011496500056011916500076012476500109013236510011014326530013014436530013014566550020014697730031014898560006015208560196015269030016017220788698  a200508       200408                        eng     aEP14421230  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aI32  aJ13  aO1510aOrphans in Africa: Parental Death, Poverty, and School Enrollment10aCase, Anne10aPaxson, Christina10aAbleidinger, Joseph  aCenter for Health and Wellbeing, Princeton U  aCenter for Health and Wellbeing, Princeton U  aCenter for Health and Wellbeing, Princeton U  aWe examine the impact of orphanhood on children's school enrollment in 10 sub-Saharan African countries. Although poorer children in Africa are less likely to attend school, the lower enrollment of orphans is not accounted for solely by their poverty. We find that orphans are less likely to be enrolled than are nonorphans with whom they live. Consistent with Hamilton's rule, the theory that the closeness of biological ties governs altruistic behavior, outcomes for orphans depend on the relatedness of orphans to their household heads. The lower enrollment of orphans is largely explained by the greater tendency of orphans to live with distant relatives or unrelated caregivers. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aAfrica  aChildren  a Poverty  aJournal Article  g41g3h483-508tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788698&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200402253naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450117001831000033003001100014003335200886003476500042012336500076012756500066013516500109014176510013015266530014015396530012015536530016015656530015015816530015015966550020016117730030016318560006016618560196016679030016018630788699  a200508       200408                        eng     aEP14421231  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ13  aJ16  aO1510aPregnancy-Related Dropouts and Gender Inequality in Education: A Life-Table Approach and Application to Cameroon20aEloundou-Enyegue, Parfait M.  aCornell U  aIn this study, I used a life-table approach to estimate how much hypothetical reductions in pregnancy-related dropouts would help close the gender gap in educational attainment. Using the schooling histories of 6,686 pupils, I partitioned Cameroon's gender gap in education into "pregnancy-related" and "non-pregnancy-related" components and simulated the impact of reductions in pregnancy-related dropouts on this gap. The results suggest that such reductions would have substantial payoffs in this setting, but payoffs would be the greatest where societies also address gender inequities before puberty and outside the realm of pregnancy. Reductions in pregnancy-related dropouts complement but do not replace efforts to reduce gender discrimination in schooling. Recent data from Demographic and Health Surveys should make it possible to extend this analysis to other countries. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aCameroon  aEducation  a Gender  a Inequality  a Pregnancy  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g41g3h509-28tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788699&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200401973naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450058001751000021002337000022002541100014002767100011002905200724003016500076010256500125011016500049012266510010012756530010012856530014012956530019013096530015013286550020013437730030013638560006013938560196013999030016015950788700  a200508       200408                        eng     aEP14421232  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO16  aZ1210aPervasive Muslim-Hindu Fertility Differences in India10aDharmalingam, A.10aMorgan, S.

We found that Muslims are much more likely than Hindus to intend to have additional children and, among those who do not want more children, Muslims are much less likely than Hindus to use contraceptives. These findings are robust to model specification and pervasive across the states of India. This national study provides the context within which local studies should be enmeshed and begs for general (as opposed to place-specific) explanations for these pervasive differences. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Financial Markets; Saving and Capital Investment; Corporate Finance and Governance         b(O16) 4aCultural Economics: Religion         b(Z12)  aIndia  aChild  a Children  a Contraceptive  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g41g3h529-45tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788700&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200402517naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450075001751000021002507000023002717000022002941100057003167100009003737100065003825201176004476500042016236500084016656500076017496510011018256530010018366530015018466530014018616550020018757730030018958560006019258560196019319030016021270788701  a200508       200408                        eng     aEP14421233  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ12  aJ1310aBirth Month, School Graduation, and the Timing of Births and Marriages10aSkirbekk, Vegard10aKohler, Hans-Peter10aPrskawetz, Alexia  aInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis  aU PA  aVienna Institute of Demography, Austrian Academy of Sciences  aWe investigated the timing of fertility and marriage in Sweden using exogenous variation in the age at school graduation that results from differences in birth month. Our analysis found that the difference of 11 months in the age at leaving school between women who were born in two consecutive months, December and January, implies a delay in the age at first birth of 4.9 months. This effect of delayed graduation also persists for the timing of second births and first marriages, but it does not affect completed fertility or the overall probability of marriage before age 45. These results suggest the existence of a relatively rigid sequencing of demographic events in early adulthood, and the age at graduation from school emerges as an important factor in determining the timing--but not the quantum--of family formation. In addition, these effects point to a potentially important influence of social age, defined by an individual's school cohort, instead of biological age. The relevance of social age is likely due to social interactions and peer-group influences exerted by individuals who are in the same school cohort but are not necessarily of the same age. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aSweden  aBirth  a Fertility  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g41g3h547-68tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788701&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200402105naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450060001751000023002357000017002587000018002751100035002937100012003287100012003405200821003526500038011736500084012116500076012956510009013716530010013806530011013906530014014016530012014156530012014276550020014397730030014598560006014898560196014959030016016910788702  a200508       200408                        eng     aEP14421234  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ12  aJ1310aEffects of Child Health on Parents' Relationship Status10aReichman, Nancy E.10aCorman, Hope10aNoonan, Kelly  aU Medicine and Dentistry of NJ  aRider U  aRider U  aWe used data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to estimate the effect of a child's poor health on the presence of the father.

We found that within this short period, having a child with poor health decreased the probability that the parents lived together by 10 percentage points. It also increased the probability that their relationship status moved in the direction of less involvement by 6 percentage points.

Using data from the American Housing Survey, we found substantial and significant gaps in housing equity for blacks and Hispanics (but not for Asians) compared with whites, even after we controlled for a wide range of locational, life-cycle, socioeconomic, family, immigrant, and mortgage characteristics. Furthermore, the payoffs to many factors are notably weaker for minority than for white households. This finding is especially consistent across groups for the effects of age, socioeconomic status, and housing-market value. Blacks and Hispanics also uniformly receive less benefit from mortgage and housing characteristics than do whites. These findings lend credence to the burgeoning stratification perspective on wealth and housing inequality that acknowledges the importance of broader social and institutional processes of racial-ethnic stratification that advantage some groups, whites in this case, over others. 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aHousing Supply and Markets         b(R31)  aU.S.  aHomes  a Housing  a Inequality  a Racial  a Wealth  aJournal Article  g41g3h585-605tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0788703&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200402106naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450039001671000024002067000020002301100020002507100024002705200938002946500117012326500066013496510009014156530015014246530012014396530015014516530013014666530011014796550020014907730031015108560006015418560196015479030013017430735585  a200407       200405                        eng     aEP13494318  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI38  aJ1610aWelfare Reform and Female Headship10aFitzgerald, John M.10aRibar, David C.  aBowdoin College  aGeorge Washington U  aWhile much of the focus of recent welfare reforms has been on moving recipients from welfare to work, many reforms were also directed at decisions regarding living arrangements, pregnancy, marriage, and cohabitation. This article assesses the impact of welfare reform waivers and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs on women's decisions to become unmarried heads of families, controlling for confounding influences from local economic and social conditions. We pooled data from the 1990, 1992, 1993, and 1996 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation, which span the period when many states began to adopt welfare waivers and to implement TANF, and estimated logit models of the incidence of female headship and state-stratified, Cox proportional hazard models of the rates of entry into and exit from headship. We found little consistent evidence that waivers affected female headship of families. 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aAssistance  a Female  a Pregnancy  a Welfare  a Women  aJournal Article  g41g2h189-212tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0735585&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200402096naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450057001671000024002241100029002485200923002776500117012006500084013176510009014016530012014106530014014226530013014366530012014496530019014616530013014806550020014937730030015138560006015438560196015499030013017450735586  a200407       200405                        eng     aEP13494319  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI38  aJ1213aThe Impact of Welfare Reform on Marriage and Divorce10aBitler, Marianne P.  aRAND Corporation and IZA  aThe goal of the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act was to end needy parents' dependence on governmental benefits, in part by promoting marriage. The prereform welfare system was widely believed to discourage marriage because it provided benefits primarily to single mothers. However, welfare reform may have actually decreased the incentives to be married by giving women greater financial independence via the program's new emphasis on work. This article uses vital statistics data on marriages and divorces during 1989-2000 to examine the role of welfare reform (state waivers and implementation of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families) and other state-level variables on flows into and out of marriage. The results indicate that welfare reform has led to fewer new divorces and fewer new marriages, although the latter result is sensitive to specification and the choice of data. 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aDivorce  a Marriage  a Mothers  a Parent  a Single Mother  a Welfare  aJournal Article  g41g2h213-36tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0735586&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200402121naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450040001591000020001997000020002197000019002391100015002587100016002737100019002895201116003086500084014246510009015086530013015176530012015306550020015427730030015628560006015928560196015989030013017940735587  a200407       200405                        eng     aEP13494320  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aUnion Formation in Fragile Families10aCarlson, Marcia10aMcLanahan, Sara10aEngland, Paula  aColumbia U  aPrinceton U  aNorthwestern U  aIn this article, we use data from a new longitudinal survey--the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study--to examine union formation among unmarried parents who have just had a child together. We used multinomial logistic regression to estimate the effects of economic, cultural/interpersonal, and other factors on whether (relative to having no romantic relationship) parents are romantically involved and living apart, cohabiting, or married to each other about one year after the child's birth. Net of other factors (including baseline relationship status), women's education and men's earnings encourage marriage. Cultural and interpersonal factors also have strong effects: women's trust of men, both parents' positive attitudes toward marriage, and both parents' assessment of the supportiveness in their relationship encourage marriage. Supportiveness also encourages cohabitation, while fathers having a problem with alcohol or drugs and reporting higher conflict in the relationship discourage cohabitation. Fathers' physical violence deters couples' remaining in romantic nonresident relationships. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aFamilies  a Parent  aJournal Article  g41g2h237-61tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0735587&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200401803naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450071001671000018002381100015002565200746002716500084010176500066011016510009011676530011011766530012011876530014011996530011012136550020012247730030012448560006012748560196012809030013014760735588  a200407       200405                        eng     aEP13494321  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1610aGender Differences in the Marriage and Cohabitation Income Premium10aLight, Audrey  aOH State U  aUsing data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, I identify causal effects of marriage and cohabitation on total family income. My goals are to compare men's and women's changes in financial status upon entering unions and to assess the relative contributions of adjustments in own income, income pooling, and changes in family size. Changes in own income that are due to intrahousehold specialization prove to be minor for both men and women relative to the effects of adding another adult's income to the family total. Women gain roughly 55% in needs-adjusted, total family income, regardless of whether they cohabit or marry, whereas men's needs-adjusted income levels remain unchanged when men make these same transitions. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aFamily  a Gender  a Marriage  a Women  aJournal Article  g41g2h263-84tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0735588&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200401811naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450065001591000021002247000022002451100061002677100021003285200797003496500076011466510009012226530010012316530014012416550020012557730031012758560006013068560196013129030013015080735589  a200407       200405                        eng     aEP13494322  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aSelf-Care: Why Do Parents Leave Their Children Unsupervised?10aCasper, Lynne M.10aSmith, Kristin E.  aNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development  aUS Census Bureau  aWe used a preferences-and-constraints model to develop four hypotheses to explain why parents may choose self-care (an unsupervised arrangement) as the primary child care arrangement for their children over supervised alternatives and tested them in a multivariate framework using 1995 data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation. We found that the choice of self-care over supervised care alternatives is linked to the availability of parents' time to care for children, the child's level of responsibility and maturity, and the neighborhood context. However, we found no evidence that parents' ability to pay for child care is related to the choice of self-care. The results also suggest that parents use different decision-making processes, depending on their children's ages. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  aJournal Article  g41g2h285-301tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0735589&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200401631naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450073001591000019002321100051002515200750003026500038010526510009010906530013010996550020011127730030011328560006011628560196011689030013013640735590  a200407       200405                        eng     aEP13494323  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1210aContinuous and Robust Measures of the Overweight Epidemic: 1971-200010aJolliffe, Dean  aPublic Policy Institute, Georgetown U and USDA  aThis article considers alternate measures of the overweight epidemic that are more robust to measurement error, continuous in the body-mass index (BMI) at the overweight threshold, and sensitive to changes in the BMI distribution. The measures suggest that prevalence rates may understate the severity of the overweight problem. Since 1971, the prevalence of overweight has increased by 37%, while the distribution-sensitive measure has increased by 173%. Furthermore, although Hispanics have the highest prevalence of overweight, the distribution-sensitive measures reveal that overweight Hispanics exceed the overweight threshold by the smallest proportion (21%), whereas overweight non-Hispanic blacks exceed the threshold by 33%, on average. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aEpidemic  aJournal Article  g41g2h303-14tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0735590&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200401817naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450063001671000024002307000025002541100040002797100040003195200669003596500038010286500077010666510016011436530011011596530016011706530012011866530016011986550020012147730030012348560006012648560196012709030013014660735591  a200407       200405                        eng     aEP13494324  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1110aDecomposition of Differences in Health Expectancy by Cause10aNusselder, Wilma J.10aLooman, Caspar W.

We present a new method to correct the bias and apply it to data from a longitudinal survey of about 9,000 oldest-old Chinese aged 80-105 collected in 1998 and 2000. In our application, the age trajectories of disability (activities of daily living--ADL), status-specific death rates, and the probabilities of transitions between ADL states of the oldest-old were investigated for the first time in a developing country. In this article, we report estimates of bias-corrected disabled and active life expectancies of the Chinese oldest-old and demonstrate patterns of large differences associated with initial status, gender, and advances in ages. Using combined information on ADL disabilities and length of having been bedridden before dying, we analyze gender and age patterns of the extent of morbidity before dying among the oldest-old and their implications for debates on the hypothesis of compression of morbidity. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population         b(P23) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Other         b(P39)  aChina  aDeaths  aJournal Article  g41g2h335-61tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0735592&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200402097naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450084001831000017002677000023002841100039003077100009003465200613003556500077009686500109010456500123011546500072012776510010013496530014013596530017013736530012013906530016014026530016014186550020014347730030014548560006014848560196014909030013016860735593  a200407       200405                        eng     aEP13494326  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aO15  aP23  aP3913aThe Household Registration System and Social Stratification in China: 1955-199610aWu, Xiaogang10aTreiman, Donald J.  aHong Kong U Science and Technology  aUCLA  aThe Chinese household registration system (hukou), which divides the population into "agricultural" and "nonagricultural" sectors, may be the most important determinant of differential privileges in state socialist China, determining access to good jobs, education for one's children, housing, health care, and even the right to move to a city. Transforming one's hukou status from rural to urban is a central aspect of upward social mobility. Using data from a 1996 national probability sample, we show that education and membership in the Chinese Communist Party are the main determinants of such mobility. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population         b(P23) 4aSocialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Other         b(P39)  aChina  aEducation  a Health Care  a Health  a Population  a Socialists  aJournal Article  g41g2h363-84tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0735593&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200402446naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450071001671000019002387000021002577000021002781100013002997100052003127100009003645201118003736500113014916500172016046510009017766530011017856530016017966530016018126550020018287730028018488560006018768560196018829030018020780727804  a200405       200402                        eng     aEP12618577  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aR2310aSegregation of Minorities in the Metropolis: Two Decades of Change10aLogan, John R.10aStults, Brian J.10aFarley, Reynolds  aU Albany  aCenter for Studies in Criminology and Law, U FL  aU MI  aData from Census 2000 show that black-white segregation declined modestly at the national level after 1980, while Hispanic and Asian segregation rose in most metropolitan areas. Changes that may have produced greater changes for blacks proved to have insignificant effects: there was no net shift of the black population toward less-segregated areas, segregation at the metropolitan level did not decline more in areas where the incomes of blacks came closer to the incomes of whites over time, and the emergence of more multiethnic metropolises had no impact. As in the past, declines were centered in the South and West and in areas with smaller black populations. Increases in Hispanic and Asian segregation in individual metropolitan areas were counterbalanced by a net movement of these two groups toward areas of lower segregation. These increases were associated especially with the more rapid growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations. Hispanic segregation increased more in regions where group members had declining incomes relative to the incomes of whites and included a growing share of immigrants. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Minorities  a Population  aJournal Article  g41g1h1-22tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0727804&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200402056naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450049001671000017002167000018002331100023002517100009002745200897002836500113011806500172012936510009014656530011014746550020014857730029015058560006015348560196015409030018017360727805  a200405       200402                        eng     aEP12618578  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aR2310aHypersegregation in the Twenty-First Century10aWilkes, Rima10aIceland, John  aU British Columbia  aU MD  aWe used metropolitan-level data from the 2000 U.S. census to analyze the hypersegregation of four groups from whites: blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans. While blacks were hypersegregated in 29 metropolitan areas and Hispanics were hypersegregated in 2, Asians and Native Americans were not hypersegregated in any. There were declines in the number of metropolitan areas with black hypersegregation, although levels of segregation experienced by blacks remained significantly higher than those of the other groups, even after a number of factors were controlled. Indeed, although socioeconomic differences among the groups explain some of the difference in residential patterns more generally, they have little association with hypersegregation in particular, indicating the overarching salience of race in shaping residential patterns in these highly divided metropolitan areas. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aCensus  aJournal Article  g41g1h23-36tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0727805&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200402340naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450107001601000023002671100043002905201220003336500113015536500081016666500172017476510009019196530009019286530014019376530014019516550020019657730029019858560006020149030018020200727806  a200405       200402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aR12  aR2310aDistinguishing the Geographic Levels and Social Dimensions of U.S. Metropolitan Segregation, 1960-200010aFischer, Claude S.  aSurvey Research Center, U CA, Berkeley  aIn this article, we assess trends in residential segregation in the United States from 1960 to 2000 along several dimensions of race and ethnicity, class, and life cycle and present a method for attributing segregation to nested geographic levels. We measured segregation for metropolitan America using the Theil index, which is additively decomposed into contributions of regional, metropolitan, center city-suburban, place, and tract segregation. This procedure distinguishes whether groups live apart because members cluster in different neighborhoods, communities, metropolitan areas, or regions. Substantively, we found that the segregation of blacks decreased considerably after 1960 largely because neighborhoods became more integrated, but the foreign born became more segregated largely because they concentrated in particular metropolitan areas. Class segregation increased between 1970 and 1990 mainly because the affluent increasingly clustered in specific metropolitan areas and in specific municipalities within metropolitan areas. The unmarried increasingly congregated in center cities. The main purpose of this article is to describe and illustrate this multilevel approach to studying segregation. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aSize and Spatial Distributions of Regional Economic Activity         b(R12) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aRace  a Regional  a Suburban  aJournal Article  g41g1h37-59tDemography  iN  aFebruary 200400836naa  2200205   4500001001100000008004400011022001300055245010800068100002300176700002500199700001600224700001800240710006900258710006400327655001200391773001000403856000600413856019900419903001200618EP12618579       200402                        eng     a0070337010aDISTINGUISHING THE GEOGRAPHIC LEVELS AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF U.S. METROPOLITAN SEGREGATION, 1960-2000.10aFischer, Claude S.10aStockmayer, Gretchen10aStiles, Jon10aHout, Michael  aDepartment of Sociology, University of California, Berkeley, CA.  aSurvey Research Center, University of California, Berkeley.  aArticle  g41g1  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=EP12618579&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFeb200402317naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450083001751000021002587000021002791100015003007100009003155201018003246500056013426500084013986500113014826510009015956530017016046530017016216530014016386530012016526530010016646550020016747730029016948560006017238560196017299030018019250727807  a200405       200402                        eng     aEP12618580  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI32  aJ12  aJ1510aPoverty and Macroeconomic Performance across Space, Race, and Family Structure10aGundersen, Craig10aZiliak, James P.  aIA State U  aU KY  aWe examined the effects of macroeconomic performance and social policy on the extent and depth of poverty in America using state-level panel data from the 1981-2000 waves of the Current Population Survey. We found that a strong macroeconomy at both the state and national levels reduced both the number of families who were living in poverty and the severity of poverty. The magnitude and source of these antipoverty effects, however, were not uniform across family structures and racial groups or necessarily over time. While gains in the eradication of poverty, in general, were tempered by rising wage inequality, simulations indicated that female-headed families and families that were headed by black persons experienced substantial reductions in poverty in the 1990s largely because of the growth in median wages. An auxiliary time-series analysis suggests that the expansions in the federal Earned Income Tax Credit of the 1990s accounted for upward of 50% of the reduction in after-tax income deprivation. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aAnti Poverty  a Antipoverty  a Families  a Family  a Race  aJournal Article  g41g1h61-86tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0727807&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200402132naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450096001591000021002557000023002761100015002997100020003145201189003346500038015236510009015616530014015706550020015847730030016048560006016348560196016409030018018360727808  a200405       200402                        eng     aEP12618581  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1213aThe Long Arm of Childhood: The Influence of Early-Life Social Conditions on Men's Mortality10aHayward, Mark D.10aGorman, Bridget K.  aPA State U  aRice U and U TX  aIncreasingly, social scientists are turning to childhood to gain a better understanding of the fundamental social causes of adult mortality. However, evidence of the link between childhood and the mortality of adults is fragmentary, and the intervening mechanisms remain unclear. Drawing on the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men, our analysis shows that men's mortality is associated with an array of childhood conditions, including socioeconomic status, family living arrangements, mother's work status, rural residence, and parents' nativity. With the exception of parental nativity, socioeconomic-achievement processes in adulthood and lifestyle factors mediated these associations. Education, family income, household wealth, and occupation mediated the influence of socioeconomic status in childhood. Adult lifestyle factors, particularly body mass, mediated the effects of family living arrangements in childhood, mother's work status, and rural residence. Our findings bring into sharp focus the idea that economic and educational policies that are targeted at children's well-being are implicitly health policies with effects that reach far into the adult life course. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aMortality  aJournal Article  g41g1h87-107tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0727808&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200402014naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450090001751000017002651100036002825200793003186500038011116500108011496500113012576510009013706530011013796530013013906530015014036550020014187730030014388560006014688560196014749030018016700727809  a200405       200402                        eng     aEP12618582  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ14  aJ1510aMortality among Elderly Hispanics in the United States: Past Evidence and New Results10aElo, Irma T.  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aWe used vital records and census data and Medicare and NUMIDENT records to estimate age- and sex-specific death rates for elderly non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics, including five Hispanic subgroups: persons born in Cuba, Mexico, Puerto Rico, other foreign countries, and the United States.

We also present a new methodology for inferring Hispanic origin from a combination of surname, given name, and county of residence. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Elderly  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g41g1h109-28tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0727809&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200402481naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450075001751000026002507000024002761100015003007100024003155201095003396500077014346500076015116500113015876510009017006530010017096530018017196530013017376530015017506530015017656530017017806530016017976550020018137730030018338560006018638560196018699030018020650727810  a200405       200402                        eng     aEP12618583  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ13  aJ1513aThe Fertility Contribution of Mexican Immigration to the United States10aJonsson, Stefan Hrafn10aRendall, Michael S.  aPA State U  aRAND and PA State U  aCrucial to the long-term contribution of immigration to a receiving country's population is the extent to which the immigrants reproduce themselves in subsequent, native-born generations. Using conventional projection methodologies, this fertility contribution may be poorly estimated primarily because of problems in projecting the number of immigrants who are at risk of childbearing. We propose an alternative method that obviates the need to project the number of immigrants by using the full sending-country birth cohort as the risk group to project their receiving-country childbearing. This "sending-country birth cohort" method is found to perform dramatically better than conventional methods when projecting to 1999 from base years both before and after the large increase in inflows of Mexican immigrants to the United States in the late 1980s. Projecting forward from 1999, we estimate a cumulative contribution of Mexican immigrant fertility from the 1980s to 2040 of 36 million births, including 25% to 50% more births after 1995 than are projected using conventional methods. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Childbearing  a Cohorts  a Fertility  a Immigrant  a Immigration  a Population  aJournal Article  g41g1h129-50tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0727810&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200402162naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450089001831000023002727000023002951100013003187100016003315200721003476500044010686500077011126500109011896500172012986510017014706530028014876530015015156550020015307730030015508560006015808560196015869030018017820727811  a200405       200402                        eng     aEP12618584  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aF22  aJ11  aO15  aR2313aThe Limits to Cumulative Causation: International Migration from Mexican Urban Areas10aFussell, Elizabeth10aMassey, Douglas S.  aTulane U  aPrinceton U  aWe present theoretical arguments and empirical research to suggest that the principal mechanisms of cumulative causation do not function in large urban settings.

With event-history models, we found little positive effect of community-level social capital and a strong deterrent effect of urban labor markets on the likelihood of first and later U.S. trips for residents of urban areas in Mexico, suggesting that the social process of migration from urban areas is distinct from that in the more widely studied rural migrant-sending communities of Mexico. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aMexico; U.S.  aInternational Migration  a Migration  aJournal Article  g41g1h151-71tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0727811&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200401858naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450087001671000021002541100023002755200745002986500084010436500113011276510011012406530013012516530010012646530012012746550020012867730030013068560006013368560196013429030018015380727812  a200405       200402                        eng     aEP12618585  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1510aInsight into Ethnic Flux: Marriage Patterns among Jews of Mixed Ancestry in Israel10aOkun, Barbara S.  aHebrew U Jerusalem  aIncreases in ethnic and racial intermarriage in immigrant countries have led to growing proportions of persons of mixed ancestry and backgrounds. The marriage patterns of these persons both reflect and affect the salience and meaning of current forms of ethnicity and race in these societies. This article analyzes the marriage behavior of children of ethnically mixed unions in the Jewish population of Israel. Among persons of mixed ancestry, educational attainment plays a large role in whether they marry Ashkenazim or less economically advantaged Mizrahim. Such patterns suggest that intermarriage in Israel does not necessarily reduce ethnic differences in socioeconomic status or the salience of ethnicity among disadvantaged groups. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aIsrael  aMarriage  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g41g1h173-87tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0727812&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200401601naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450064001671000022002311100011002535200515002646500076007796500077008556510022009326530013009546530018009676530015009856530016010006550020010167730031010368560006010678560196010739030018012690673308  a200402       200311                        eng     aEP11955909  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1110aIs Low Fertility a Twenty-First-Century Demographic Crisis?10aMorgan, S.

Moreover, new estimates of white marital fertility, based on "own-children" methods, suggest that the decline in marital fertility did not begin in the nation as a whole until after the Civil War (1861-1865). 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aFertility  aJournal Article  g40g4h605-20tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0673309&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLaWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200302440naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450057001671000019002247000026002431100015002697100015002845201333002996500077016326500076017096530010017856530018017956530015018136530016018286550020018447730030018648560006018948560196019009030018020960673310  a200402       200311                        eng     aEP11955911  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ1310aModeling Momentum in Gradual Demographic Transitions10aSchoen, Robert10aJonsson, Stefan Hrafn  aPA State U  aPA State U  aThe analysis of population momentum following a gradual decline in fertility to replacement level provides valuable insights into prospects for future population growth. Here, we extend recent work in the area by applying a new form of the quadratic hyperstable (QH) model, which relates exponentially changing fertility to the resultant exponentiated quadratic birth sequence. Modeling gradual transitions from an initial stable population to an ultimate stationary population indicates that such declines in fertility increase momentum by a product of two factors. The first factor is a previously noted continuation of stable growth for half the period of decline. The second is a not previously appreciated offsetting factor that reflects the interaction between the decline in fertility, the changing age pattern of fertility, and the changing age composition of the population. Numerical examples using both hypothetical and actual populations demonstrate that for declines of any length, the product of the two factors yields momentum values that closely agree with the results of population projections. The QH model can examine monotonic transitions between any two sets of constant vital rates. As a generalization of the fixed-rate stable model, it has great potential value in numerous areas of demographic analysis. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aBirth  a Demographics  a Fertility  a Population  aJournal Article  g40g4h621-35tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0673310&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200302504naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450056001831000021002397000026002601100064002867100064003505201046004146500076014606500066015366500077016026500109016796510010017886530011017986530015018096530012018246530012018366550020018487730030018688560006018988560196019049030018021000673311  a200402       200311                        eng     aEP11955912  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ16  aJ11  aO1510aFertility Decline and Gender Bias in Northern India10aBhat, P.

By analyzing the data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), we present evidence from northern India to show that the preference for sons is reduced when the ideal family size becomes small, even though it does not completely disappear. This finding appears to contradict trends in the juvenile sex ratio and the incidence of female feticide that suggest the intensification of gender bias. We argue that the anomaly is the result of a diffusion of prenatal sex-diagnostic techniques in regions where there is a large unmet demand for such methods. Using the NFHS data, we estimate that in northern India, girls currently constitute about 60% of the unwanted births and that the elimination of unwanted fertility has the potential to raise the sex ratio at birth to 130 boys per 100 girls. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aIndia  aFemale  a Fertility  a Gender  a Health  aJournal Article  g40g4h637-57tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0673311&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200302491naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450093001831000020002767000018002967000019003141100038003337100082003717100038004535200914004916500076014056500066014816500077015476500109016246510019017336530018017526530018017706530012017886530011018006550020018117730030018318560006018618560196018679030018020630673312  a200402       200311                        eng     aEP11955913  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ16  aJ11  aO1510aTrends in Reproductive Behavior among Young Single Women in Colombia and Peru: 1985-199910aAli, Mohamed M.10aCleland, John10aShah, Iqbal H.  aWorld Health Organization, Geneva  aCentre for Population Studies, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  aWorld Health Organization, Geneva  aUsing "calendar" data for single women aged 15-24 from successive Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in Colombia and Peru during the 1990s, we document trends, year by year, in sexual activity, the use of contraceptives, and subsequent reproductive outcomes. We provide evidence of the important and hitherto largely untapped potential of DHS calendar data to draw complete sexual and reproductive profiles when data from various surveys are integrated. Over the period 1985-1999, young single women in both Colombia and Peru became sexually active at younger ages. The use of contraceptives, especially the use of condoms, increased but did not fully offset the rise in sexual activity, and thus the incidence of premarital conceptions rose among young single women. In both countries, sharp declines occurred in the proportion of premaritally conceived births that were reported as being wanted. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aColombia; Peru  aContraceptive  a Demographics  a Health  a Women  aJournal Article  g40g4h659-73tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0673312&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200301963naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450123001671000022002901100021003125200896003336500038012296500076012676510009013436530011013526530013013636530015013766550020013917730030014118560006014418560196014479030018016430673313  a200402       200311                        eng     aEP11955914  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1310aEarly Origins of the Gradient: The Relationship between Socioeconomic Status and Infant Mortality in the United States10aFinch, Brian Karl  aRAND Corporation  aAlthough relationships between social conditions and health have been documented for centuries, the past few decades have witnessed the emergence of socioeconomic gradients in health and mortality in most developed countries. These gradients indicate that health improves, although decreasingly so, at higher levels of socioeconomic status. To minimize problems with reverse causality, I tested competing hypotheses for observed socioeconomic gradients for infant mortality outcomes. I found no support for the income-inequality hypothesis and negligible support for the occupational-grade hypothesis. The results indicate that absolute material conditions are the most important determinants of socioeconomic effects on the risk of infant mortality and that while poverty has the most pronounced effect on risk, income is decreasingly salutary across the majority of the mortality gradient. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aHealth  a Infants  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g40g4h675-99tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0673313&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200302002naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450095001751000020002707000019002901100021003097100009003305200725003396500038010646500113011026500076012156510009012916530010013006530013013106530013013236530010013366530012013466550020013587730030013788560006014088560196014149030018016100673314  a200402       200311                        eng     aEP11955915  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ15  aJ1311aAn Investigation of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Birth Weight in Chicago Neighborhoods10aSastry, Narayan10aHussey, Jon M.  aRAND Corporation  aU NC  aWe examine differences in the mean birth weights of infants born to non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Mexican-origin Hispanic mothers (of any race) in Chicago in 1990 using linear regression models with neighborhood fixed effects.

Differences in the relationship between measured characteristics and birth weight accounted for around half the birth-weight gap between non-Hispanic black and other infants. Efforts to close this gap must go beyond programs that aim to reduce the level of risk factors among black women to address the causes of differences in the effects of risk factors. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Infants  a Mothers  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g40g4h701-25tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0673314&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200302246naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450100001671000020002677000021002871100036003087100036003445201125003806500038015056500108015436510009016516530014016606550020016747730030016948560006017248560196017309030018019260673315  a200402       200311                        eng     aEP11955916  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1410aVerification of the Ages of Supercentenarians in the United States: Results of a Matching Study10aRosenwaike, Ira10aStone, Leslie F.  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aUnprecedented declines in mortality among the very old have led to the emergence of "true" supercentenarians (persons aged 110 and over). The ages of these individuals have been well-documented in European countries with a history of birth registration, but have not been systematically studied in the United States, which lacks similar documentation and where the inaccuracy of age reporting has been an issue. To verify age, we linked records from the Social Security Administration for close to 700 individuals who died from 1980 to 1999 purportedly at ages 110 and older to records of the U.S. censuses of 1880 and 1900, conducted when these individuals were children. This group was a residual group from an earlier file that was reduced by the SSA after data checks that eliminated incorrect records. The results of the matched records for the residual file indicate that over 90% of the whites were accurately reported as supercentenarians, but only half of the blacks appeared to have attained age 110. The verification of age shows that the United States has more "true" supercentenarians than do other nations. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aMortality  aJournal Article  g40g4h727-39tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0673315&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200302070naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450051001591000022002107000017002321100009002497100041002585201122002996500077014216510009014986530015015076550020015227730030015428560006015728560196015789030018017740673316  a200402       200311                        eng     aEP11955917  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1111aAn Evaluation of Population Projections by Age10aSmith, Stanley K.10aTayman, Jeff  aU FL  aSan Diego Association of Governments  aA number of studies have evaluated the accuracy of projections of the size of the total population, but few have considered the accuracy of projections by age group. For many purposes, however, the relevant variable is the population of a particular age group, rather than the population as a whole. We investigated the precision and bias of a variety of age-group projections at the national and state levels in the United States and for counties in Florida. We also compared the accuracy of state and county projections that were derived from full-blown applications of the cohort-component method with the accuracy of projections that were derived from a simpler, less data-intensive version of the method. We found that age-group error patterns are different for national projections than for subnational projections; that errors are substantially larger for some age groups than for others; that differences in errors among age groups decline as the projection horizon becomes longer; and that differences in methodological complexity have no consistent impact on the precision and bias of age-group projections. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aPopulation  aJournal Article  g40g4h741-57tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0673316&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200301955naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450086001671000023002537000022002761100015002987100012003135200834003256500077011596500076012366510009013126530012013216530015013336530011013486550020013597730030013798560006014098560196014159030018016110673317  a200402       200311                        eng     aEP11955918  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ1313aThe Academic Trajectories of Immigrant Youths: Analysis within and across Cohorts10aGlick, Jennifer E.10aWhite, Michael J.  aAZ State U  aBrown U  aTwo nationally representative cohorts--from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) and High School and Beyond (HSB)--were used to examine the effects of generation and duration of residence on students' performance on standardized tests over a two-year period. In multivariate models, generational status predicts variation in students' performance on baseline (sophomore) tests, with effects stronger for the later age cohort (NELS) than for the earlier age cohort (HSB). With regard to the trajectory of achievement, generational status has a greatly reduced role for both cohorts. The best predictors of the trajectory of achievement are not those that are based on nativity per se, but those that reflect the social environment experienced in the United States (i.e., ethnicity and family's socioeconomic status). 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aCohorts  a Immigrant  a Youth  aJournal Article  g40g4h759-83tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0673317&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200302159naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450110001831000021002931100063003145200732003776500076011096500109011856500038012946500084013326510010014166530010014266530015014366530014014516530012014656530012014776530015014896550020015047730031015248560006015558560196015619030016017570666032  a200311       200308                        eng     aEP10775692  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO15  aI12  aJ1210aSelective Gender Differences in Childhood Nutrition and Immunization in Rural India: The Role of Siblings10aPande, Rohini P.  aInternational Center for Research on Women, Washington, DC  aThis article examines the role of the sex composition of surviving older siblings on gender differences in childhood nutrition and immunization, using data from the National Family Health Survey, India (1992-1993).

The results show selective neglect of children with certain sex and birth-order combinations that operate differentially for girls and boys. Both girls and boys who were born after multiple same-sex siblings experience poor outcomes, suggesting that parents want some balance in sex composition. However, the preference for sons persists, and boys who were born after multiple daughters have the best possible outcomes. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aIndia  aBirth  a Childhood  a Children  a Family  a Health  a Nutrition  aJournal Article  g40g3h395-418tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0666032&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200302087naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001750430008001832450105001911000022002961100036003185200621003546500066009756500049010416500038010906500076011286500109012046510043013136530010013566530013013666530015013796530016013946530011014106550020014217730030014418560006014718560196014779030016016730666033  a200311       200308                        eng     aEP10775693  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aZ12  aI12  aJ13  aO1510aWomen's Autonomy and Child Survival: A Comparison of Muslims and Non-Muslims in Four Asian Countries10aGhuman, Sharon J.  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aIn this article, I evaluate the hypothesis that higher infant and child mortality among Muslim populations is related to the lower autonomy of Muslim women using data from 15 pairs of Muslim and non-Muslim communities in India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Women's autonomy in various spheres is not consistently lower in Muslim than in non-Muslim settings.

We report that apprehensions of persons attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally declined immediately following passage of the law but returned to normal levels during the period when undocumented immigrants could file for amnesty and the years thereafter. Our findings suggest that the amnesty program did not change long-term patterns of undocumented immigration from Mexico. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aIllegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law         b(K42) 4aDemographic Economics: Public Policy         b(J18)  aMexico; U.S.  aImmigrant  a Immigration  a Law  aJournal Article  g40g3h437-50tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0666034&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200301924naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450090001671000022002577000023002791100019003027100019003215200683003406500117010236500084011406510011012246530012012356530014012476530013012616530019012746530013012936550020013067730030013268560006013568560196013629030016015580666035  a200311       200308                        eng     aEP10775695  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI38  aJ1210aHow an Earnings Supplement Can Affect Union Formation among Low-Income Single Mothers10aHarknett, Kristen10aGennetian, Lisa A.  aU CA, Berkeley  aMDTC, New York  aUsing data from an experimental evaluation in two Canadian provinces, we found that offering an earnings supplement to single mothers in place of welfare altered rates of marriage and cohabitation, but that the direction of the effects varied by province. Our findings suggest that research on the relationship between women's economic well-being and marital decisions at the national level is likely to mask important variation at the local level. After eliminating several explanations for the opposite effects in the two provinces, we propose that local labor markets and local policy contexts are potentially important mediating characteristics of marriage and cohabitation. 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aCanada  aMarital  a Marriage  a Mothers  a Single Mother  a Welfare  aJournal Article  g40g3h451-78tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0666035&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200302058naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450096001751000022002717000023002937000023003161100015003397100009003547100040003635200683004036500117010866500076012036500066012796510009013456530010013546530014013646530013013786530013013916550020014047730030014248560006014548560196014609030016016560666036  a200311       200308                        eng     aEP10775696  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI38  aJ13  aJ1610aWelfare Work Requirements and Child Well-Being: Evidence from the Effects on Breast-Feeding10aHaider, Steven J.10aJacknowitz, Alison10aSchoeni, Robert F.  aMI State U  aRAND  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aA central theme of welfare reform is that recipients are required to engage in work activities. In many states, these work requirements apply to mothers whose children are a few months old, which may increase the costs and decrease the prevalence of breast-feeding. Given the substantial benefits of breast-feeding, any reduction represents an important negative consequence of these requirements. Our results suggest that in the absence of welfare reform, the national breast-feeding rate six months after birth would have been 5.5% higher in 2000. Such negative consequences of these policies must be weighed against potential benefits as states refine their welfare programs. 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Mothers  a Welfare  aJournal Article  g40g3h479-97tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0666036&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200302064naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450121001751000018002961100021003145200877003356500056012126500084012686500069013526510009014216530011014306530012014416530016014536550020014697730031014898560006015208560196015269030016017220666037  a200311       200308                        eng     aEP10775697  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI32  aJ12  aD3110aWhy Poverty Remains High: The Role of Income Growth, Economic Inequality, and Changes in Family Structure, 1949-199910aIceland, John  aUS Census Bureau  aAfter dramatic declines in poverty from 1950 to the early 1970s in the United States, progress stalled. This article examines the association between trends in poverty and income growth, economic inequality, and changes in family structure using three measures of poverty: an absolute measure, a relative measure, and a quasi-relative one. I found that income growth explains most of the trend in absolute poverty, while inequality generally plays the most significant role in explaining trends in relative poverty. Rising inequality in the 1970s and 1980s was especially important in explaining increases in poverty among Hispanics, whereas changes in family structure played a significant role for children and African Americans through 1990. Notably, changes in family structure no longer had a significant association with trends in poverty for any group in the 1990s. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31)  aU.S.  aFamily  a Income  a Inequality  aJournal Article  g40g3h499-519tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0666037&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200302250naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450075001671000021002421100015002635201122002786500069014006500084014696510009015536530013015626530012015756530016015876530017016036530012016206530012016326550020016447730030016648560006016948560196017009030016018960666038  a200311       200308                        eng     aEP10775698  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD31  aJ1210aSharing the Wealth: The Effect of Siblings on Adults' Wealth Ownership10aKeister, Lisa A.  aOH State U  aInequality in wealth has been well-documented, but its causes remain uncertain. Family processes in childhood are likely to shape adults' wealth accumulation, but these factors have attracted little attention. I argue that family size matters: children from larger families accumulate less wealth than do those from smaller families. Siblings dilute parents' finite financial resources and nonmaterial resources, such as time. This diminishment of resources reduces educational attainment, inter vivos transfers, and inheritance. Reduced educational attainment and transfers alter financial behavior; saving; and, ultimately, adults' wealth. I demonstrate that sibship size is associated with lower overall wealth in adulthood and that parents' resources and education, respondent's education, financial transfers, and financial behavior all mitigate the effect of siblings. Sibship size also reduces the likelihood of receiving a trust account or an inheritance and decreases home and stock ownership. The findings provide important insights into early family processes that shape wealth accumulation and inequality. 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aFamilies  a Family  a Inequality  a Inheritance  a Parent  a Wealth  aJournal Article  g40g3h521-42tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0666038&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200302353naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450079001751000024002541100018002785201183002966500066014796500083015456500041016286510023016696530011016926530016017036530017017196530011017366550020017477730030017678560006017978560196018039030016019990666039  a200311       200308                        eng     aEP10775699  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aJ24  aJ7110aRethinking Gender Segregation and Gender Inequality: Measures and Meanings10aBridges, William P.  aU IL, Chicago  aIt is often assumed that occupational segregation by gender is readily interpretable as an index of inequality between men and women in the labor force. Although this view has been challenged, the development and dissemination of analytic tools that could test this assumption have been limited. This article reviews two methods for identifying invidious and noninvidious components of gender segregation and develops a third approach that overcomes some limitations of the other two. Each method is applied to a data set that consists of observations from 22 countries covered in the International Social Survey Program. The results are compared and contrasted, and several conclusions emerge. First, occupational segregation is not completely interpretable as occupational gender inequality. Second, the methods differ in how large they estimate the invidious (vertical) component to be. Third, each method produces measures of invidious and noninvidious segregation that can be predicted statistically from other characteristics of the countries in question. The article ends with suggestions about the circumstances under which the various approaches may be the most useful. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71)  aSelected Countries  aGender  a Inequality  a Segregation  a Women  aJournal Article  g40g3h543-68tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0666039&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200301847naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450067001671000029002347000021002631100012002847100017002965200723003136500084010366500113011206510009012336530011012426530012012536550020012657730030012858560006013158560196013219030016015170666040  a200311       200308                        eng     aEP10775700  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1513aThe Racial Crossover in Family Complexity in the United States10aGoldscheider, Frances K.10aBures, Regina M.  aBrown U  aSUNY, Albany  aThis article examines the evolution of the black extended family by documenting a black-white crossover in the proportions of unmarried adults living in complex households after the middle of the twentieth century.

In this context, the higher level of family extension that recent research has found typifies black families is both a relatively new phenomenon and one that is not just limited to single-parent families; it characterizes all ages, those with and without children, and men as well as women. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aFamily  a Racial  aJournal Article  g40g3h569-87tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0666040&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200301829naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450108001671000021002757000027002961100050003237100094003735200624004676500077010916500038011686510018012066530011012246530015012356550020012507730030012708560006013008560196013069030013015020656697  a200308       200305                        eng     aEP10077421  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aI1210aDecomposing Change in Life Expectancy: A Bouquet of Formulas in Honor of Nathan Keyfitz's 90th Birthday10aVaupel, James W.10aCanudus Romo, Vladimir  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research and Population Research Centre, U Groningen  aWe extend Nathan Keyfitz's research on continuous change in life expectancy over time by presenting and proving a new formula for decomposing such change. The formula separates change in life expectancy over time into two terms. The first term captures the general effect of reduction in death rates at all ages, and the second term captures the effect of heterogeneity in the pace of improvement in mortality at different ages. We extend the formula to decompose change in life expectancy into age-specific and cause-specific components, and apply the methods to analyze changes in life expectancy in Sweden and Japan. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aJapan; Sweden  aDeaths  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g40g2h201-16tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0656697&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200302091naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450098001751000023002731100051002965200868003476500077012156500109012926500038014016510014014396530017014536530014014706530016014846550020015007730030015208560006015508560196015569030013017520656698  a200308       200305                        eng     aEP10077422  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aO15  aI1210aHIV and Population Dynamics: A General Model and Maximum-Likelihood Standards for East Africa10aHeuveline, Patrick  aPopulation Research Center, NORC and U Chicago  aIn high-prevalence populations, the HIV epidemic undermines the validity of past empirical models and related demographic techniques. A parsimonious model of HIV and population dynamics is presented here and fit to 46,000 observations, gathered from 11 East African populations. The fitted model simulates HIV and population dynamics with standard demographic inputs and only two additional parameters for the onset and scale of the epidemic. The underestimation of the general prevalence of HIV in samples of pregnant women and the fertility impact of HIV are examples of the dynamic interactions that demographic models must reproduce and are shown here to increase over time even with constant prevalence levels. As a result, the impact of HIV on population growth appears to have been underestimated by current population projections that ignore this dynamic. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aE.

This analysis, based on data collected from over 6,000 unmarried adolescents in two districts of Kenya--Nyeri and Kisumu--indicates substantial and significant differences in reported rates of premarital sex across interview modes, although not always in the expected direction. Our assumption that girls underreport sexual activity in face-to-face interviews by comparison with ACASI is not confirmed by the Nyeri data, but our results from Kisumu are considerably more promising. As for boys, who we believe exaggerate their level of sexual activity in face-to-face interviews, a more nuanced set of expectations regarding the reporting of sensitive behaviors was offered; our results from Kisumu, although not always significant, by and large conform to expectations. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aKenya  aAdolescent  aJournal Article  g40g2h247-68tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0656699&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200301991naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001592450102001671000023002691100020002925200909003126500066012216500109012876510015013966530014014116530011014256550020014367730030014568560006014868560196014929030013016880656700  a200308       200305                        eng     aEP10077424  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aO1510aWomen's Status and Domestic Violence in Rural Bangladesh: Individual- and Community-Level Effects10aKoenig, Michael A.  aJohns Hopkins U  aWe explore the determinants of domestic violence in two rural areas of Bangladesh. We found increased education, higher socioeconomic status, non-Muslim religion, and extended family residence to be associated with lower risks of violence. The effects of women's status on violence was found to be highly context-specific. In the more culturally conservative area, higher individual-level women's autonomy and short-term membership in savings and credit groups were both associated with significantly elevated risks of violence, and community-level variables were unrelated to violence. In the less culturally conservative area, in contrast, individual-level women's status indicators were unrelated to the risk of violence, and community-level measures of women's status were associated with significantly lower risks of violence, presumably by reinforcing nascent normative changes in gender relations. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBangladesh  aEducation  a Women  aJournal Article  g40g2h269-88tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0656700&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200302029naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001670430008001752450064001831000020002477000027002671100016002947100016003105200742003266500077010686500109011456500044012546500065012986510011013636530012013746530015013866550020014017730031014218560006014528560196014589030013016540656701  a200308       200305                        eng     aEP10077425  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aO15  aF22  aJ6110aEngendering Migrant Networks: The Case of Mexican Migration10aCurran, Sara R.20aRivero-Fuentes, Estela  aPrinceton U  aPrinceton U  aThis article compares the impact of family migrant and destination-specific networks on international and internal migration.

For moves to the United States, male migrant networks are more important for prospective male migrants than for female migrants, and female migrant networks lower the odds of male migration, but significantly increase female migration. We suggest that distinguishing the gender composition and destination content of migrant networks deepens our understanding of how cumulative causation affects patterns of Mexican migration. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aMexico  aMigrant  a Migration  aJournal Article  g40g2h289-307tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0656701&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200302119naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450110001751000020002851100016003055200945003216500038012666500042013046500077013466510009014236530012014326530018014446530015014626530012014776530015014896550020015047730030015248560006015548560196015609030013017560656702  a200308       200305                        eng     aEP10077426  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aI21  aJ1110aCohort and Life-Course Patterns in the Relationship between Education and Health: A Hierarchical Approach10aLynch, Scott M.  aPrinceton U  aRecent medical sociological research has examined whether the relationship between education and health is dynamic across age, whereas recent demographic research has examined whether the relationship varies across cohorts. In this study, I examine how cohort structures the influence of education on life-course health trajectories. At the cohort level, changes in education and in the distribution of health and mortality make cohort differences in education's effect probable. At the life-course level, the effect of education may vary across age because the mediators of the education-health relationship may vary in their relevance to health across the life course. Using basic regression analyses and random-effects models of two national data sets, I find that the effect of education strengthens across age, that this pattern is becoming stronger across cohorts, and that these patterns are suppressed when either effect is ignored. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aCohorts  a Demographics  a Education  a Health  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g40g2h309-31tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0656702&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200302025naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450048001751000021002237000017002441100009002617100009002705200761002796500084010406500066011246500076011906510009012666530013012756530011012886530011012996530012013106530013013226530014013356530013013496550020013627730030013828560006014128560196014189030013016140656703  a200308       200305                        eng     aEP10077427  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ16  aJ1310aChild Gender and the Transition to Marriage10aLundberg, Shelly10aRose, Elaina  aU WA  aU WA  aWe estimate the effect of a child's gender on the mother's probability of marriage or remarriage using data from the PSID Marital History and Childbirth and Adoption History Files. We find that the birth of a son speeds the transition into marriage when the child is born before the mother's first marriage. A competing-risks analysis shows that the positive effect of a son is stronger for marriages to the child's biological father than for other marriages. We find no significant effect of child gender on the mother's remarriage probabilities when the children are born within a previous marriage. These results are consistent with a marital-search model in which sons, more than daughters, increase the value of marriage relative to single parenthood. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAdoption  a Birth  a Child  a Gender  a Marital  a Marriage  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g40g2h333-49tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0656703&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200301642naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001512450064001591000012002231100040002355200718002756500084009936510009010776530013010866530012010996550020011117730030011318560006011618560196011679030013013630656704  a200308       200305                        eng     aEP10077428  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aEconomic Potential and Entry into Marriage and Cohabitation10aXie, Yu  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aThis article explores the relationship between economic potential and rates of entry into marriage and cohabitation. Using data from the 1990 census and the 1980-1992 High School and Beyond (Sophomore Cohort), we developed a method for explicitly estimating five time-varying measures of earnings potential. The analyses of union formation are based on an intergenerational panel study of parents and children, to which our measures of earnings potential were appended. The results indicate that all five measures of earnings potential strongly and positively influence the likelihood of marriage for men, but not for women. Earnings potential does not affect entry into cohabiting unions for either men or women. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aMarriage  a Parent  aJournal Article  g40g2h351-67tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0656704&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200301965naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160015000630220013000780370060000910430008001510430008001590430008001672450139001751000020003141100009003345200789003436500056011326500052011886500048012406510009012886530012012976530016013096530021013256530016013466550020013627730030013828560006014128560196014189030013016140656705  a200308       200305                        eng     aEP10077430  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aH55  aJ26  aI3110aSocial Security, Age of Retirement, and Economic Well-Being: Intertemporal and Demographic Patterns among Retired-Worker Beneficiaries10aHaveman, Robert  aU WI  aWe examine the economic status of a sample of new recipients of social security retired-worker benefits shortly after their first receipt of benefits (1982) and 10 years later (1991). The probability that these retired-worker beneficiaries were poor or near-poor is positively and strongly associated with their acceptance of early retired-worker benefits. Early retirees, women who remained single, and women who lost their spouses experienced large declines in economic status over the decade following their first receipt of benefits. Although both women and men who first received benefits at younger ages had lower economic status than did those who became beneficiaries at older ages, this retirement age-related disadvantage increased over the decade for women but not for men. 4aSocial Security and Public Pensions         b(H55) 4aRetirement; Retirement Policies         b(J26) 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31)  aU.S.  aRetiree  a Retirement  a Social Security  a Well Being  aJournal Article  g40g2h369-94tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0656705&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200302038naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450099001741000018002737000017002911100037003087100037003455200714003826500077010966500076011736500109012496510014013586530018013726530018013906530012014086550020014207730028014408560006014688560196014749030018016700636735  a200304       200302                        eng     aEP9211883  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ13  aO1511aAppropriate Methods for Analyzing the Effect of Method Choice on Contraceptive Discontinuation10aSteele, Fiona10aCurtis, Sian  aInstitute of Education, U London  aCarolina Population Center, U NC  aThe contraceptive method chosen is an important determinant of contraceptive discontinuation. However, method choice is endogenous to contraceptive discontinuation. Using data from the 1997 Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey, we apply a multilevel multiprocess model to examine the impact of method choice on three types of contraceptive discontinuation. We confirm that method choice is endogenous to the processes of contraceptive abandonment and method switching, but not failure. Ignoring the endogeneity of contraceptive choice leads to various biases in the magnitude of estimated effects of method choice on abandonment and method switching, but the general conclusions are robust to these biases. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aIndonesia  aContraceptive  a Demographics  a Health  aJournal Article  g40g1h1-22tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0636735&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200302636naa  2200457   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001740430008001820430008001900430008001982450110002061000020003167000017003361100023003537100015003765200736003916500108011276500123012356500077013586500084014356500109015196500119016286500103017476510010018506530011018606530016018716530011018876530011018986550020019097730029019298560006019588560196019649030018021600636736  a200304       200302                        eng     aEP9211884  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ14  aP23  aJ11  aJ12  aO15  aO18  aP2510aFamily Size and Support of Older Adults in Urban and Rural China: Current Effects and Future Implications10aZimmer, Zachary10aKwong, Julia  aPopulation Council  aU Manitoba  aChange in China's age structure is creating concerns about whether reductions in family size undermine traditional support mechanisms for older adults. Future generations may expect less support as the availability of children declines. In this article, the association between number of children and the receipt of instrumental and financial support is examined for rural and urban populations. Probabilities are modeled as bivariate probits. Coefficients are used to conduct simulations in which support is examined across hypothetical distributions of number of children. The results show that the number of children is an important determinant of support, but future reductions in support may not be as dramatic as anticipated. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population         b(P23) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Urban, Rural, and Regional Economics         b(P25)  aChina  aFamily  a Population  a Rural  a Urban  aJournal Article  g40g1h23-44tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0636736&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200302335naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450083001741000020002571100009002775201158002866500038014446500066014826500077015486510029016256530011016546530012016656530015016776530013016926530011017056550020017167730029017368560006017658560196017719030018019670636737  a200304       200302                        eng     aEP9211885  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ16  aJ1110aDeclining Sex Differences in Mortality from Lung Cancer in High-Income Nations10aPampel, Fred C.  aU CO  aAfter decades of widening, the difference in mortality from lung cancer between men and women has begun to narrow in recent years. Recognizing that the increase in smoking among women relative to men is the proximate cause of the changing sex difference in rates of lung cancer, I analyzed two approaches to identify the more distant sources of the changes. A gender-equality argument suggests that the difference is related to the more general equalization of women's and men's work and family roles, which also encourages the adoption of harmful behaviors such as smoking by women. An alternative explanation suggests that the convergence in mortality from lung cancer among men and women is the byproduct of a lag in the adoption, diffusion, and abatement of smoking by women. Using mortality data on 21 nations from 1955 to 1996, an analysis of logged rates of men's and women's lung cancer mortality and the logged ratio of the rates demonstrated little relationship between the sex difference and gender equality. However, I found a strong and consistent relationship between the sex difference and the stage of diffusion of the use of cigarettes. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aMDCs; Selected Countries  aCancer  a Gender  a Mortality  a Smoking  a Women  aJournal Article  g40g1h45-65tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0636737&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200301868naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450091001661000022002571100015002795200792002946500077010866500084011636510012012476530012012596530014012716530012012856550020012977730029013178560006013468560196013529030018015480636738  a200304       200302                        eng     aEP9211886  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ1213aThe Joint Effects of Marriage Partners' Socioeconomic Positions on the Risk of Divorce10aJalovaara, Marika  aU Helsinki  aThis study investigated the joint effects of spouses' socioeconomic positions on the risk of divorce in Finland. For couples in which both partners were at the lowest educational level, the risk of divorce was lower than could be expected on the basis of the previously documented overall inverse association between each spouse's education and the risk of divorce. Women who were employed or were homemakers, and who had employed husbands, had comparatively stable marriages; couples in which the husband, the wife, or both partners were unemployed had an elevated risk of divorce. A husband's high income decreased the risk of divorce, and a wife's high income increased the risk at all levels of the other spouse's income, but especially when the wife's income exceeded the husband's. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aFinland  aDivorce  a Marriage  a Spouse  aJournal Article  g40g1h67-81tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0636738&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200301952naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001742450085001821000020002671100009002875200718002966500042010146500084010566500077011406500066012176510010012836530014012936530014013076530011013216550020013327730030013528560006013828560196013889030018015840636739  a200304       200302                        eng     aEP9211887  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ12  aJ11  aJ1610aEducational Attainment and the Transition to First Marriage among Japanese Women10aRaymo, James M.  aU WI  aI use data from a large nationally representative survey to examine the relationship between women's educational attainment and the timing of first marriage in Japan. The results indicate that later marriage for highly educated women primarily reflects longer enrollment in school, that university education is increasingly associated with later and less marriage, and that the trend toward later and less marriage is occurring at all levels of educational attainment. These findings are consistent, albeit weakly, with the argument that higher education should be negatively associated with marriage only in countries in which gender relations make it particularly difficult for women to balance work and family. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aJapan  aEducation  a Marriage  a Women  aJournal Article  g40g1h83-103tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0636739&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200302147naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001742450115001821000021002971100016003185200760003346500084010946500076011786500077012546500066013316510009013976530010014066530018014166530014014346530016014486530016014646530011014806550020014917730030015118560006015418560196015479030018017430636740  a200304       200302                        eng     aEP9211888  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ13  aJ11  aJ1613aThe Impact of Economic Resources on Premarital Childbearing and Subsequent Marriage among Young American Women10aAassve, Arnstein  aU Leicester  aThis paper extends previous work on premarital childbearing by modeling both the entry rates and the exit rates of unwed motherhood among young American women. In particular, I investigate the impact of economic resources on the likelihood of experiencing a premarital birth and then of subsequent marriage. Using a multiple-destination, multiple-spell hazard regression model and a microsimulation analysis, I analyze the accumulating effects of various economic variables. The results show that the economic resources are indeed important both for premarital childbearing and for subsequent marriage. However, the simulations show that large changes in these economic variables do not necessarily translate into large changes in nonmarital childbearing. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aBirth  a Childbearing  a Marriage  a Motherhood  a Premarital  a Women  aJournal Article  g40g1h105-26tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0636740&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200302242naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001742450074001821000033002561100009002895200953002986500084012516500113013356500077014486500076015256510009016016530013016106530011016236550020016347730030016548560006016848560196016909030018018860636741  a200304       200302                        eng     aEP9211889  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ15  aJ11  aJ1310aCohabiting and Marriage during Young Men's Career-Development Process10aOppenheimer, Valerie Kincade  aUCLA  aUsing recently released cohabitation data for the male sample of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, first interviewed in 1979, I conducted multinomial discrete-time event-history analyses of how young men's career-development process affects both the formation and the dissolution of cohabiting unions. For a substantial proportion of young men, cohabitation seemed to represent an adaptive strategy during a period of career immaturity, whereas marriage was afar more likely outcome for both stably employed cohabitors and noncohabitors alike. Earnings positively affected the entry into either a cohabiting or marital union but exhibited a strong threshold effect. Once the men were in cohabiting unions, however, earnings had little effect on the odds of marrying. Men with better long-run socioeconomic prospects were far more likely to marry from either the noncohabiting or cohabiting state, and this was particularly true for blacks. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aMarriage  a Youth  aJournal Article  g40g1h127-49tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0636741&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200302087naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001742450061001821000014002437000021002571100021002787100009002995200746003086500117010546500076011716500042012476500077012896510009013666530014013756530014013896530015014036530013014186550020014317730030014518560006014818560196014879030018016830636742  a200304       200302                        eng     aEP9211890  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI38  aJ13  aI21  aJ1110aDo Children from Welfare Families Obtain Less Education?10aKu, Inhoe10aPlotnick, Robert  aSeoul National U  aU WA  aIn this study, we analyzed whether parents' receipt of welfare affects children's educational attainment in early adulthood, independent of its effect through changing family income. We used data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with information on parents' welfare receipt over the first 15 years of childhood. Cross-sectional results show that greater exposure to welfare is significantly associated with children's poorer educational attainment. Family fixed-effect regressions also indicate a negative effect of exposure to welfare, but its overall pattern is less consistent. Although exposure to welfare in early childhood has no effect, in adolescence and, to a lesser degree, in middle childhood, its effect is often negative. 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aChildhood  a Children  a Education  a Welfare  aJournal Article  g40g1h151-70tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0636742&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200302305naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001740430008001822450082001901000018002727000016002907000023003061100016003297100026003457100016003715200710003876500084010976500076011816500117012576500077013746500057014516510009015086530018015176530011015356530018015466530013015646530012015776550020015897730030016098560006016398560196016459030018018410636743  a200304       200302                        eng     aEP9211891  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ13  aI38  aJ11  aJ1810aExplaining Trends in Child Support: Economic, Demographic, and Policy Effects10aCase, Anne C.10aLin, I.-Fen10aMcLanahan, Sara S.  aPrinceton U  aBowling Green State U  aPrinceton U  aWe use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to examine trends in the receipt of child support (and the determinants of trends) between 1968 and 1997.

These negative forces were offset by the passage of new mid-support legislation in the 1980s and 1990s, including numeric guidelines, universal withholding, and genetic testing. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aDemographic Economics: Public Policy         b(J18)  aU.S.  aChild Support  a Child  a Demographics  a Divorce  a Policy  aJournal Article  g40g1h171-89tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0636743&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200302054naa  2200421   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001740430008001822450078001901000017002687000020002851100015003057100015003205200618003356500076009536500057010296500084010866500066011706500053012366510009012896530010012986530011013086530012013196530019013316530011013506550020013617730031013818560006014128560196014189030018016140636744  a200304       200302                        eng     aEP9211892  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ18  aJ12  aJ16  aJ2210aParental Leave: The Impact of Recent Legislation on Parents' Leave Taking10aHan, Wen-Jui10aWaldfogel, Jane  aColumbia U  aColumbia U  aWe use data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to examine the impact of leave entitlements on unpaid leave usage by men and women after the birth of a child from 1991 to 1999.

The results for women are mixed: in some specifications, leave entitlements are associated with increased leave taking or longer leaves, but the results depend on how we define leave coverage.

Immigration, the major source of the contemporary diversification of the population, provides several lessons about how to prepare for that future within a framework of social justice and how to realign recent demographic trends with cherished democratic principles. A review of historical and contemporary controversies about the representation of the foreign-born and alien suffrage both illustrates the reemergence of ascriptive civic hierarchies and highlights some potentially deleterious social and civic consequences of recent demographic trends. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEquity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement         b(D63) 4aPolitical Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior         b(D72) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Demography  a Equity  a Immigration  a Justice  a Population  aJournal Article  g39g4h587-616tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0634916&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200201931naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450122001661000021002887000019003091100017003287100017003455200711003626500065010736500117011386510009012556530014012646530012012786530020012906530013013106550020013237730030013438560006013738560196013799030018015750634917  a200303       200211                        eng     aEP8893551  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ61  aI3811aAssessing Immigrant Policy Options: Labor Market Conditions and Postreform Declines in Immigrants' Receipt of Welfare10aLofstrom, Magnus10aBean, Frank D.  aU TX, Dallas  aU CA, Irvine  aResearchers infrequently have focused on assessing the degree to which the changes in welfare policy legislated during the 1990s have affected immigrants' receipt of welfare. Using data from the March Current Population Survey, we analyze the contribution of local labor market conditions to the explanation of relative declines in immigrants' receipt of welfare from 1994 to 2000. The results of a series of models that included labor market-area and state fixed effects indicate that employment and unemployment rates across metropolitan statistical areas and states account for at least one-third of the observed relative decrease among immigrants.

Using administrative data about students in California public schools, we found that Spanish-speaking, limited English-proficient (LEP) children have become increasingly more likely to attend schools with low-income, minority, and LEP students than other non-LEP and LEP groups. Nearly all the change in school composition can be attributed to statewide shifts in the composition of the school-aged population. But compositional changes have disproportionately occurred in schools attended by Spanish-speaking LEP students as a result of district-level patterns of segregation by income, race/ethnicity, and language. 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g39g4h639-54tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0634918&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200202474naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001742450066001821000023002481100021002715201146002926500042014386500113014806500065015936500172016586510009018306530015018396530012018546550020018667730030018868560006019168560196019229030018021180634919  a200303       200211                        eng     aEP8893553  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ15  aJ61  aR2310aPrivate Schools and 'Latino Flight' from Black Schoolchildren10aFairlie, Robert W.  aU CA, Santa Cruz  aSeveral recent studies provided evidence that white students' choice between private and public schools is influenced by the racial composition of the local student population. None of these studies, however, examined whether Latinos are also fleeing to private schools in response to black schoolchildren. I explore the "Latino-flight" hypothesis using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study and a recently released confidential data set from the National Center for Educational Statistics. In probit regressions for the probability of Latinos attending private schools, I found a large, positive, and statistically significant coefficient on the black share of the school-age population. The coefficient estimates imply that a 10-percentage point increase in the black share increases the probability of private school attendance by 25.7% to 33.2% among Latino 8th graders and 35.2% to 52.2% among Latino 10th graders. I interpret these results as providing evidence of "Latino flight" from public schools into private schools. I did not find evidence that Latinos respond differently to black schoolchildren than do whites. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aPopulation  a Racial  aJournal Article  g39g4h655-74tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0634919&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200202093naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450072001741000018002461100018002645200819002826500113011016500172012146500065013866510009014516530015014606530010014756530012014856550020014977730030015178560006015478560196015539030018017490634920  a200303       200211                        eng     aEP8893554  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aR23  aJ6110aWhites Who Say They'd Flee: Who Are They, and Why Would They Leave?10aKrysan, Maria  aU IL, Chicago  aQuestions have been raised about whether white flight--one factor contributing to U.S. residential segregation--is driven by racial, race-associated, or neutral ethnocentric concerns. I use closed- and open-ended survey data from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality to explore who says they would leave and their reasons for doing so. Thirty-eight percent of white respondents said they would leave one of the integrated neighborhoods, with Detroiters and those endorsing negative racial stereotypes especially likely to do so. When asked why they might leave, whites focused on the negative features of integrated neighborhoods. Expressions of racial prejudice were also common, but neutral ethnocentrism rare.

Estimates of households and the group quarters population can be derived directly from concurrent data series, but estimates of PPH have traditionally been based on previous values or estimates for larger areas. In our study, we developed several regression models in which PPH estimates were based on symptomatic indicators of PPH change. We tested these estimates using county-level data in four states and found them to be more precise and less biased than estimates based on more commonly used methods. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Household Analysis: General         b(R20)  aU.S.  aPopulation  aJournal Article  g39g4h697-712tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0634921&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200202004naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450114001661000021002807000023003017000025003241100009003497100009003587100009003675200788003766500076011646500109012406510010013496530018013596530019013776550020013967730030014168560006014468560196014529030018016480634922  a200303       200211                        eng     aEP8893556  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO1510aSocial Networks and Changes in Contraceptive Use over Time: Evidence from a Longitudinal Study in Rural Kenya10aBehrman, Jere R.10aKohler, Hans-Peter10aWatkins, Susan Cotts  aU PA  aU PA  aU PA  aThe impacts of social networks on changes in contraception in rural Kenya are investigated using special data from a longitudinal household survey.

Children's Height in Brazil and South Africa10aBurgard, Sarah  aUCLA  aI examine racial differences in child stunting in mid-1990s South Africa and Brazil, two multiracial societies with different histories of legal support for racial discrimination. Using data from nationally representative household samples linked to community-level measures, the analysis shows that racial inequality in the distribution of socioeconomic resources across households and communities explains much of the racial difference in stunting in both countries. Even after these factors are controlled, however, the results indicate that in South Africa, nonwhite children are still at greater risk of growth faltering than are white children. The nature of socioeconomic and racial differences in children's growth is examined, and major determinants are discussed. These findings suggest that although state-sanctioned racism may help to explain the greater racial inequality in stunting in South Africa than in Brazil, the eradication of a disadvantage for nonwhites will depend on changes in the same fundamental socioeconomic inequalities that characterize both nations. 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aBrazil; South Africa  aDiscrimination  a Distribution  a Inequality  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g39g4h763-90tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0634924&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200201830naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001502450053001581000025002117000020002361100046002567100016003025200781003186500084010996510009011836530017011926530014012096530013012236530012012366550020012487730030012688560006012988560196013049030016015000618954  a200210       200208                        eng     aEP7316447  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1213aThe Living Arrangements of New Unmarried Mothers20aSigle-Rushton, Wendy10aMcLanahan, Sara  aLondon School of Econ & Political Science  aPrinceton U  aWe use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to describe the living arrangements of new, unwed mothers and to examine the selection process that underlies choices of living arrangements. Our analysis goes beyond previous studies by examining a wide diversity of living arrangements for a homogenous sample of recent unwed mothers and by using information on both parents' demographic and human capital characteristics and the quality of their relationships. We find that about half the new unwed mothers are cohabiting at the time their children are born, and only 17% are living alone. We also find that mothers' choices of living arrangements are significantly related to parents' human capital, the quality of their relationship, and the cost of housing. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Families  a Mothers  a Parent  aJournal Article  g39g3h415-33tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0618954&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200201682naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001502450088001581000020002467000027002661100018002937100034003115200710003456500084010556510009011396550020011487730030011688560006011988560196012049030016014000618955  a200210       200208                        eng     aEP7316448  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1211aAn Empirical Analysis of the Matching Patterns of Same-Sex and Opposite-Sex Couples10aJepsen, Lisa K.10aJepsen, Christopher A.  aU Northern IA  aPublic Policy Institute of CA  aWe used 1990 Census data to compare the matching behaviors of four types of cohabiting couples: same-sex male couples, same-sex female couples, opposite-sex unmarried couples, and married couples.

The positive assortative mating, however, is stronger for non-labor-market traits (e.g., age, education) than for labor-market traits (e.g., hourly earnings). Further, members of married couples are more alike with respect to most characteristics than are members of opposite-sex cohabiting couples, and members of opposite-sex cohabiting couples are more alike than are members of same-sex couples. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g39g3h435-53tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0618955&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200202112naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001502450103001581000021002617000026002827000018003081100009003267100015003357100015003505201071003656500084014366510009015206530013015296550020015427730030015628560006015928560196015989030016017940618956  a200210       200208                        eng     aEP7316449  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aHow Well Can We Track Cohabitation Using the SIPP?

Still, research that explores links between living arrangements and economic behavior is limited by a lack of data that explicitly identify cohabiting couples. To aid researchers in using the Survey of Income and Program Participation's (SIPP) rich data to explore cohabitation issues, we consider direct and inferred measures of cohabitation. We find, first, that the use of inferred definitions (relative to direct measures) in the SIPP is likely to yield higher cohabitation rates in the United States by incorrectly coding roommates as cohabiters. Second, the SIPP (whether by direct or inferred measures) counts a significantly larger number of cohabiting couples than the widely used Current Population Survey (CPS). Third, spells of cohabitation occur less frequently and last longer when a direct measure of cohabitation is used than when either of the two inferred measures of cohabitation is used; ours is the first article to reveal this result. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aMarriage  aJournal Article  g39g3h455-65tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0618956&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200202105naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450136001661000018003021100017003205200980003376500113013176500077014306510009015076530014015166530017015306550020015477730030015678560006015978560196016039030016017990618957  a200210       200208                        eng     aEP7316450  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aJ1110aOnly English by the Third Generation?

Using the 5% Integrated Public Use Microdata Sample 1990 file, we examine the home languages of second- and third-generation children and compare the degree of their language shift against that among the descendants of European immigrants, as evidenced in the 1940 and 1970 censuses. Overall, the rates of speaking only English for a number of contemporary groups suggest that Anglicization is occurring at roughly the same pace for Asians as it did for Europeans, but is slower among the descendants of Spanish speakers. Multivariate models for three critical groups--Chinese, Cubans, and Mexicans--indicate that the home languages of third-generation children are most affected by factors, such as intermarriage, that determine the languages spoken by adults and by the communal context. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  a Immigration  aJournal Article  g39g3h467-84tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0618957&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200201554naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450084001661000027002507000022002771100020002997100035003195200450003546500065008046500065008696510009009346530013009436530015009566550020009717730031009918560006010228560196010289030016012240618958  a200210       200208                        eng     aEP7316451  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ61  aJ3110aInsights from Longitudinal Data on the Earnings Growth of U.S. Foreign-Born Men10aDuleep, Harriet Orcutt10aDowhan, Daniel J.  aUrban Institute  aSocial Security Administration  aDoes the growth in earnings of foreign-born men exceed that of U.S. natives?

Among all firms, the results suggest that employee referrals are just as important as the geographic location of the firm in generating employment segregation: both increase the predicted level of interfirm racial segregation among blue-collar workers in the cities studied by about 10%. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aOther Spatial Production and Pricing Analysis         b(R32) 4aPersonnel Economics: Firm Employment Decisions; Promotions         b(M51) 4aLabor Turnover; Vacancies; Layoffs         b(J63)  aU.S.  aHiring  a Racial  aJournal Article  g39g3h507-28tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0618959&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200201967naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450101001661000025002677000021002921100014003137100035003275200750003626500038011126500113011506510009012636530019012726530012012916530021013036530015013246530010013396550020013497730030013698560006013998560196014059030016016010618960  a200210       200208                        eng     aEP7316453  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1510aMortality Rates of Elderly Asian American Populations Based on Medicare and Social Security Data10aLauderdale, Diane S.10aKestenbaum, Bert  aU Chicago  aSocial Security Administration  aWe present sex- and age-specific death probabilities for the elderly of six Asian American subgroups--Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese--based on data from Social Security Administration files.

Using linked data from surveys conducted in four counties of northern China in 1991 and 1994, we compare reproductive behavior against prior fertility preferences and show when and where women change from wanting to not wanting more children. The acceptance of policy-sanctioned family size follows a development gradient and reflects the degree of enforcement. High acceptance occurs in the most urban, industrialized county and in the county with the most rigid family planning policy. Acceptance is weaker among women living in the poorest county and in the county where enforcement is most lenient. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population         b(P23) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aChina  aChild  a Children  a Development  a Family Planning  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g39g3h557-72tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0618962&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200201924naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450067001661000022002331100058002555200802003136500076011156500109011916510011013006530013013116530015013246530015013396550020013547730030013748560006014048560196014109030016016060618963  a200210       200208                        eng     aEP7316456  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO1510aReporting of Fertility Events by Men and Women in Rural Gambia10aRatcliffe, Amy A.  aMedical Research Council Laboratories, Banjul, Gambia  aWe conducted a survey of male and female fertility in rural villages in The Gambia and compared men and women's reports of recent pregnancy events in the aggregate and of children ever born for matched couples. Despite widespread polygyny and sex differences in fertility, men's and women's reports were similar. Small sex differences in reports of recent stillbirths and neonatal deaths were found. For matched couples, husbands reported 0.23 more children ever born than their wives on average, but discordant reporting had little effect on recent marital fertility rates. Modeling of discordant reports indicates that fertility reports are more likely to be underestimated by both men and women for their earliest marriages. Reliable fertility data can be collected from men in this population. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aGambia  aChildren  a Fertility  a Pregnancy  aJournal Article  g39g3h573-86tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0618963&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200202182naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001742450040001821000023002227000017002451100015002627100019002775200878002966500061011746500076012356500109013116500077014206510011014976530011015086530015015196530009015346550020015437730030015638560006015938560196015999030013017950608060  a200207       200205                        eng     aEP6961913  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD74  aJ13  aO15  aJ1110aWar, Peace, and Fertility in Angola10aAgadjanian, Victor10aPrata, Ndola  aAZ State U  aU CA, Berkeley  aUsing data from a nationally representative survey conducted in 1996, some two years after the end of a major outbreak of war, we examine the impact of war on the timing of recent births and war-related differences in reproductive preferences in Angola. We find evidence of a wartime drop and a postwar rebound in fertility, but these trends vary greatly, depending on the type and degree of exposure to war and on women's socioeconomic characteristics. At the same time, variations by parity are nonsignificant. In fertility preferences, the relative antinatalism of Angola's most modernized urban area stands out, but outside this area, differences between areas that were more and less affected by war are also noticeable. We offer interpretations of our findings and outline their implications for Angola's demographic future and demographic trends in similar settings. 4aConflict; Conflict Resolution; Alliances         b(D74) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aAngola  aBirths  a Fertility  a War  aJournal Article  g39g2h215-31tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0608060&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200202131naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001742450084001821000021002661100011002875200796002986500042010946500076011366500109012126500077013216510023013986530011014216530018014326530015014506530015014656530012014806550020014927730030015128560006015428560196015489030013017440608061  a200207       200205                        eng     aEP6961914  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ13  aO15  aJ1110aEducation and Fertility in Sub-Saharan Africa: Individual and Community Effects10aKravdal, Oystein  aU Oslo  aUsing data from Demographic and Health Surveys for 22 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, I show that the average educational level in a village or a community of a similar size has a significant depressing effect on a woman's birth rates, net of urbanization and her own education. According to simulations, average fertility for these countries would be 1.00 lower if education were expanded from the current level in the region to the relatively high level in Kenya. The exclusion of aggregate education from the model leaves a response of only 0.52. A considerable aggregate contribution is estimated even when several potential determinants of education are included. This finding illustrates the need to consider aggregate education in future assessments of the total impact of education. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aSub-Saharan Africa  aBirths  a Demographics  a Education  a Fertility  a Health  aJournal Article  g39g2h233-50tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0608061&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200202293naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001740430008001822450085001901000017002757000024002927000020003161100023003367100014003597100009003735200624003826500076010066500172010826500109012546500077013636500119014406510022015596530018015816530019015996550020016187730030016388560006016688560196016749030013018700608062  a200207       200205                        eng     aEP6961915  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aR23  aO15  aJ11  aO1810aSpatial Variation in Contraceptive Use in Bangladesh: Looking beyond the Borders10aAmin, Sajeda10aBasu, Alaka Malwade10aStephenson, Rob  aPopulation Council  aCornell U  aU NC  aThis article promotes a more complete understanding of social change by analyzing spatial patterns of contraceptive use in Bangladesh and the contiguous state of West Bengal in India. Multilevel analyses that control for variations in individual- and household-level correlates show an important role for cross-border influences only in those districts that share a common language across the border. The districts that are positive outliers in contraception hug the Bangladesh-West Bengal border. A map of outliers shows that the positive outliers form a contiguous band in a manner suggestive of a role for contagion. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18)  aBangladesh; India  aContraception  a Contraceptive  aJournal Article  g39g2h251-67tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0608062&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200202018naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450091001741000013002657000021002781100024002997100011003235200704003346500077010386500076011156500109011916510023013006530011013236530026013346530015013606530016013756550020013917730030014118560006014418560196014479030013016430608063  a200207       200205                        eng     aEP6961916  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ13  aO1511aAdjusting Period Tempo Changes with an Extension of Ryder's Basic Translation Equation10aYi, Zeng10aLand, Kenneth C.  aDuke U and Peking U  aDuke U  aWe show that the observed changes in the period tempo of fertility are biased and derive a new formula for adjusting such bias.

The extension provides a set of formulas expressing relationships of quantum-tempo between cohorts and periods under specified assumptions. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aU.S.; LDCs; Taiwan  aBirths  a Developing Countries  a Fertility  a Population  aJournal Article  g39g2h269-85tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0608063&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200201663naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001502450085001581000025002431100009002685200712002776500077009896510034010666530015011006530016011156550020011317730031011518560006011828560196011889030013013840608064  a200207       200205                        eng     aEP6961917  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1111aA Simple Method for Estimating Age-Specific Rates from Sequential Cross Sections10aSchmertmann, Carl P.  aFL U  aI develop and demonstrate a simple formula for estimating age-specific event rates for a period from "before" and "after" cross sections. The general approach applies to a wide range of estimation problems in demography, the social sciences, and epidemiology. The method arises from the formal mathematics of unstable populations and is similar in spirit to "variable-r" methods. Unlike those methods, however, the new technique does not require specialized computer programming or iterative calculations, and event rates can be calculated directly from cross-sectional data in simple spreadsheets. The article includes a formal mathematical exposition of the method, simulation tests, and several examples. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aBrazil; S.

A.  aUCLA  aUnlisted  aRAND  aWe examined the determinants of nonmarital fertility, focusing on the effects of other life-course events: education, marriage, marital dissolution, and marital fertility. Since these determinants are potentially endogenous, we modeled the processes that generate them jointly with nonmarital fertility and accounted for the sequencing of events and the unobserved correlations across processes. The results showed that the risk of nonmarital conception increases immediately after leaving school and that the educational effects are less pronounced for black women than for other women. The risk is lower for previously married women than for never-married women, even controlling for age, but this reduction is significant only for black women. The more children a woman already has, the lower her risk of nonmarital childbearing, particularly if the earlier children were born during a previous marriage. Ignoring endogeneity issues seriously biases the estimates of several substantively important effects. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21)  aU.S.  aChildbearing  a Education  a Fertility  a Marital Dissolution  a Marital  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g39g2h311-29tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0608065&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200201815naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001502450053001581000021002111100017002325200892002496500084011416510009012256530012012346530012012466530014012586550020012727730030012928560006013228560196013289030013015240608066  a200207       200205                        eng     aEP6961919  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aStability across Cohorts in Divorce Risk Factors10aTeachman, Jay D.  aWestern WA U  aOver the past quarter-century, many covariates of divorce have been identified. However, the extent to which the effects of these covariates remain constant across time is not known. In this article, I examine the stability of the effects of a wide range of divorce covariates using a pooled sample of data taken from five rounds of the National Survey of Family Growth. This sample includes consistent measures of important predictors of divorce, covers marriages formed over 35 years (1950-1984), and spans substantial historical variation in the overall risk of marital dissolution. For the most part, the effects of the major sociodemographic predictors of divorce do not vary by historical period. The one exception is race. These results suggest that the effects associated with historical period have been pervasive, simultaneously altering the risk of divorce for most marriages. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aDivorce  a Family  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g39g2h331-51tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0608066&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200202243naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450101001741000023002751100009002985201121003076500038014286500076014666500042015426510009015846530011015936530011016046530014016156530011016296550020016407730030016608560006016908560196016969030013018920608067  a200207       200205                        eng     aEP6961920  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aI2110aLow Birth Weight, Social Factors, and Developmental Outcomes among Children in the United States10aBoardman, Jason D.  aU TX  aWe used six waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-Child Data (1986-1996) to assess the relative impact of adverse birth outcomes vis-a-vis social risk factors on children's developmental outcomes.

We found some persistent adverse effects of first-year maternal employment and some positive effects of second- and third-year maternal employment on cognitive outcomes for non-Hispanic white children, but not for African American or Hispanic children. These effects are present even after we controlled for a range of individual and family characteristics that affect child development, including those that are likely to be correlated with maternal employment, such as breast-feeding and the use of nonmaternal child care. Controlling for family fixed effects reduces the effects of early maternal employment on some cognitive outcomes but not on others. 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Child  a Children  a Youth  aJournal Article  g39g2h369-92tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0608068&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200202267naa  2200457   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001740430008001822450107001901000020002977000017003171100014003347100014003485200705003626500084010676500076011516500038012276500042012656500108013076510009014156530016014246530014014406530012014546530013014666530012014796530019014916530019015106530014015296550020015437730031015638560006015948560196016009030013017960608069  a200207       200205                        eng     aEP6961922  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ13  aI12  aI21  aJ1410aGood Things Come in Threes: Single-Parent Multigenerational Family Structure and Adolescent Adjustment10aDeLeire, Thomas10aKalil, Ariel  aU Chicago  aU Chicago  aUsing data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS), we found that teenagers who live in nonmarried families are less likely to graduate from high school or to attend college, more likely to smoke or drink, and more likely to initiate sexual activity. Not all nonmarried families are alike, however. In particular, teenagers living with their single mothers and with at least one grandparent in multigenerational households have developmental outcomes that are at least as good and often better than the outcomes of teenagers in married families. These findings obtain when a wide array of economic resources, parenting behavior, and home and school characteristics are controlled for. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aAdolescents  a Families  a Family  a Mothers  a Parent  a Single Mother  a Single Parent  a Teenager  aJournal Article  g39g2h393-413tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0608069&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200202098naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001740430008001822450065001901000020002551100009002755200638002846500118009226500067010406500038011076500109011456500064012546510014013186530018013326530012013506530012013626530015013746530015013896530016014046550020014207730028014408560006014688560196014749030018016700599226  a200204       200202                        eng     aEP6346632  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aO13  aQ23  aI12  aO15  aQ2510aForest Fires, Air Pollution, and Mortality in Southeast Asia10aSastry, Narayan  aRAND  aI assess the population health effects in Malaysia of air pollution from a widespread series of fires that occurred in Indonesia between April and November of 1997.

The chance of losing an adult child during one's lifetime will be 70% higher than if there were no AIDS epidemic. 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aThailand  aAIDS  a Aids  a Children  a Demographics  a Elderly  aJournal Article  g39g1h25-41tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0599227&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200201932naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450058001741000018002321100021002505200768002716500109010396500076011486500038012246510011012626530010012736530014012836530015012976530013013126550020013257730029013458560006013748560196013809030018015760599228  a200204       200202                        eng     aEP6346634  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aO15  aJ13  aI1213aThe Effects of Kin on Child Mortality in Rural Gambia10aSear, Rebecca  aU College London  aWe analyzed data that were collected continuously between 1950 and 1974 from a rural area of the Gambia to determine the effects of kin on child mortality. Multilevel event-history models were used to demonstrate that having a living mother, maternal grandmother, or elder sisters had a significant positive effect on the survival probabilities of children, whereas having a living father, paternal grandmother, grandfather, or elder brothers had no effect. The mother's remarriage to a new husband had a detrimental effect on child survival, but there was little difference in the mortality rates of children who were born to monogamous or polygynous fathers. The implications of these results for understanding the evolution of human life-history are discussed. 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aGambia  aChild  a Children  a Mortality  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g39g1h43-63tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0599228&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200201712naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450085001741000025002591100016002845200494003006500077007946500109008716500076009806510013010566530017010696530015010866530016011016550020011177730029011378560006011668560196011729030018013680599229  a200204       200202                        eng     aEP6346635  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aO15  aJ1310aPopulation Momentum for Gradual Demographic Transitions: An Alternative Approach10aGoldstein, Joshua R.  aPrinceton U  aIn this article, I derive a simple formula for approximating the ultimate size of a population that undergoes a gradual transition to replacement fertility.

The high correlation between the two may be due to the independent effect of one on the other or to an association of both with the same or similar background factors. We used structural equation models to examine the relationship between these two interventions. The data were derived from six Demographic and Health Surveys: Zimbabwe from Sub-Saharan Africa, Thailand from Asia, Egypt and Tunisia from North Africa, and Guatemala and Colombia from Latin America. The results show that in all six countries, the use of contraceptives and MCH care are significantly associated, independent of intervening factors; this finding suggests that families develop a joint demand for better-quality health and limited family size and translate these demands into action by using health services for mothers and for children and by voluntarily regulating fertility. 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aLDCs  aChild  a Contraceptive  a Demographics  a Developing Countries  a Health Care  a Health  aJournal Article  g39g1h75-93tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0599230&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200202207naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450106001741000018002801100009002985201039003076500109013466500042014556500113014976510010016106530015016206550020016357730030016558560006016858560196016919030018018870599231  a200204       200202                        eng     aEP6346637  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aO15  aI21  aJ1510aEducational Stratification by Ethnicity in China: Enrollment and Attainment in the Early Reform Years10aHannum, Emily  aU PA  aUsing evidence about educational disparities, this article demonstrates the need for attention to minority populations in studies of social stratification in China. Analyses of data from a 1992 survey of children demonstrate substantial ethnic differences in enrollment among rural 7 to 14 year olds, with rates for ethnic Chinese boys roughly double those for girls from certain ethnic groups. Multivariate analyses indicate that the ethnic gap can be attributed, in part, to compositional differences in geographic location of residence and socioeconomic background. There is no general tendency of a greater gender gap for minorities than for the ethnic Chinese, but significant differences in the gender gap emerge across individual ethnic groups. Together with evidence from census data showing that ethnic disparities in junior high school transitions increased between 1982 and 1990, these results stress the continuing significance of ethnicity as a fundamental factor that conditions status attainment opportunities in China. 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aChina  aPopulation  aJournal Article  g39g1h95-117tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0599231&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200201642naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450099001661000019002651100008002845200608002926500108009006500038010086510009010466530012010556530015010676550020010827730030011028560006011328560196011389030018013340599232  a200204       200202                        eng     aEP6346638  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ14  aI1210aChanging Chronic Disease Rates and Long-Term Declines in Functional Limitation among Older Men10aCosta, Dora L.  aMIT  aFunctional limitation (difficulty walking, difficulty bending, paralysis, blindness in at least one eye, or deafness in at least one ear) in the United States fell at an average annual rate of 0.6% among men aged 50 to 74 from the early twentieth century to the early 1990s.

They affect the employment of low-income mothers in particular because they represent a larger portion of these mothers' earnings. I used a hazard framework to examine a mother's decisions about work and hours of work after childbirth. I focused on low-income mothers with infants because they are the ones who may be most affected by child care costs. The results showed that child care costs are a barrier to work that is larger for low-income mothers than for non-low-income mothers. Further, child care costs have large negative effects on hours of work. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aChild  a Hours of Work  a Infants  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g39g1h139-64tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0599233&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200202035naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450066001741000022002407000021002627000021002831100009003047100015003137100015003285200777003436500076011206500117011966500033013136510009013466530010013556530013013656530013013786550020013917730030014118560006014418560196014479030018016430599234  a200204       200202                        eng     aEP6346640  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aI38  aJ2310aChild Care Subsidies and the Employment of Welfare Recipients10aMeyers, Marcia K.10aHeintze, Theresa10aWolf, Douglas A.  aU WA  aColumbia U  aSyracuse U  aChanging patterns of maternal employment, coupled with stronger work requirements for welfare recipients, are increasing the demand for child care. For many families, the cost of child care creates a financial burden; for mothers with low incomes and those who are former welfare recipients, these costs may be an insurmountable barrier to employment or economic self-sufficiency. Despite increased public spending in this area, the receipt of any child care subsidy appears to be a relatively rare and uncertain event. In this study, we use data from a sample of low-income single mothers (current and recent welfare recipients in California) to estimate the probability of their receiving child care subsidies and the effect of this probability on labor market activity. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aLabor Demand         b(J23)  aU.S.  aChild  a Mothers  a Welfare  aJournal Article  g39g1h165-79tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0599234&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200202019naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001502450069001581000022002271100015002495201029002646500076012936510009013696530011013786530011013896530018014006530014014186530015014326550020014477730030014678560006014978560196015039030018016990599235  a200204       200202                        eng     aEP6346641  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1313aThe Effect of Stepchildren on Childbearing Intentions and Births10aStewart, Susan D.  aU Richmond  aThis article reports on a study of the effect of stepchildren (children from previous unions) on couples' fertility intentions and childbearing behavior using longitudinal data from the National Survey of Families and Households. The results indicated that stepchildren negatively affect childbearing intentions and childbearing risks. Intentions to have a child are weakened by one's own previous biological children and the previous biological children of one's current spouse or partner. This effect varies by the parenting configuration of the couple and gender of the respondent. Among couples with stepchildren, intentions remain high until each partner has had a biological child. Unlike women, men's previous biological children do not affect their intentions of having a child. Stepchildren exert a weak negative effect on couples' childbearing risks, and this effect is mediated by the couples' childbearing intentions. The findings suggest that stepchildren should be incorporated into future models of fertility. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Child  a Childbearing  a Children  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g39g1h181-97tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0599235&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200202288naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001502450072001581000015002307000021002457000022002661100028002887100027003167100028003435201148003716500076015196510009015956530011016046530011016156530015016266530015016416530011016566550020016677730031016878560006017188560196017249030018019200599236  a200204       200202                        eng     aEP6346642  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aOn the Validity of Retrospective Assessments of Pregnancy Intention10aJoyce, Ted10aKaestner, Robert10aKorenman, Sanders  aBaruch College and NBER  aU IL, Chicago and NBER  aBaruch College and NBER  aInformation on pregnancy intention is often gathered retrospectively (after the birth of a child). This article investigates whether the retrospective assessment of pregnancy intention leads to biased estimates of the extent or consequences of unintended fertility. Comparisons are made between pregnancy intentions ascertained during pregnancy and after birth using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. To address the bias caused by selective recognition or acknowledgment of pregnancy, we used the longitudinal feature of the data to determine actual pregnancy status at the time of interviews, which, in turn, was used as an instrumental variable for the retrospective (versus prospective) reporting of pregnancy intention. After correction for selective pregnancy recognition, we found no evidence that the retrospective assessment of pregnancy intention produces misleading estimates of either the number or the consequences of unintended births. This finding is supported by additional analyses of a small subsample of women for whom information on pregnancy intention was collected both during pregnancy and after birth. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Child  a Fertility  a Pregnancy  a Youth  aJournal Article  g39g1h199-213tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0599236&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200202179naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450076001741000021002501100009002715200977002806500084012576500166013416500076015076530011015836530013015946550020016077730030016278560006016578560196016639030018018590591106  a200201       200111                        eng     aEP5589876  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aN31  aJ1313aThe Developmental Paradigm, Reading History Sideways, and Family Change10aThornton, Arland  aU MI  aThe developmental paradigm, reading history sideways, and cross-cultural data have converged to exert a profound influence on social scientists and ordinary people. Through the use of these tools, social scientists of the 1700s and 1800s concluded that family patterns in northwest Europe had undergone many substantial changes before the early 1800s. These conclusions were accepted until the last several decades of the 1900s, when almost all were seriously challenged; many were declared to be myths. Further, the developmental paradigm, reading history sideways, and the conclusions of generations of social scientists created a package of ideas--developmental idealism--that subsequently became a powerful influence for family change in many parts of the world during the past two centuries. This developmental idealism has been a substantial force for changing living arrangements, marriage, divorce, gender relations, intergenerational relationships, and fertility. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aFamily  a History  aJournal Article  g38g4h449-65tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0591106&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200101954naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450093001661000027002591100057002865200857003436500076012006500109012766510011013856530010013966550020014067730030014268560006014568560196014629030018016580591107  a200201       200111                        eng     aEP5589877  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO1510aEthnic Variations in Observance and Rationale for Postpartum Sexual Abstinence in Malawi10aZulu, Eliya Msiyaphazi  aAfrican Population & Health Research Center, Nairobi  aUsing quantitative and qualitative data from three culturally heterogeneous ethnic groups in Malawi, I show that differences in postpartum sexual abstinence are closely associated with community-specific rationales for the practice, particularly differences in the definition and timing of child-strengthening rituals that couples are required to perform before resuming intercourse. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the primary rationale for abstinence in the study areas is not linked to child spacing. Among Tumbukas in the north, most women perform the ritual immediately after resuming menstruation. Among the other ethnic groups, the rituals can be performed at any time after the end of postpartum bleeding. The study underscores the utility of the complementary micro-level approach in understanding reproductive behavior in sub-Saharan Africa. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMalawi  aChild  aJournal Article  g38g4h467-79tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0591107&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200101824naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450095001661000026002611100009002875200705002966500076010016500109010776510015011866530013012016530019012146530019012336550020012527730030012728560006013028560196013089030018015040591108  a200201       200111                        eng     aEP5589878  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO1510aHow Do Family Planning Workers' Visits Affect Women's Contraceptive Behvior in Bangladesh?20aArends-Kuenning, Mary  aU IL  aIn Bangladesh, family planning workers' visits reduce the costs of contraception and may increase the demand. If visits increase demand or if workers are targeting their visits, past visits by family planning workers, should have a positive and significant effect on later probabilities of adopting contraceptive methods. Longitudinal data show that past visits are not significant in hazard models for adoption of contraceptive methods, whereas visits in the current round are significant. Therefore family planning workers' visits affect women's contraceptive behavior by decreasing the costs of contraception. Results of contraceptive discontinuation hazard models further support this hypothesis. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBangladesh  aAdoption  a Contraception  a Contraceptive  aJournal Article  g38g4h481-96tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0591108&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200101490naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001502450073001581000021002311100015002525200558002676500076008256530018009016530019009196530015009386550020009537730031009738560006010048560196010109030018012060591109  a200201       200111                        eng     aEP5589879  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aIs Breast-Feeding a Substitute for Contraception in Family Planning?10aRous, Jeffrey J.  aU North TX  aUsing data from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, I disentangle the complex interrelationship between breast-feeding, postpartum amenorrhea, and choice of contraceptive method.

The concurrent increases in life expectancy and DFLE during the period maintained the occupational disparities in health; the years lived with disability, however, declined for all groups, as for the entire French population. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Europe: Pre-1913         b(N33)  aFrance  aDisability  a Health  a Population  aJournal Article  g38g4h513-24tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0591110&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200102145naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450124001741000021002987000023003197000016003421100021003587100045003797100021004245200764004456500038012096500108012476500064013556510016014196530010014356530017014456530012014626530015014746550020014897730030015098560006015398560196015459030018017410591111  a200201       200111                        eng     aEP5589881  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ14  aH5110aLife Expectancies in Specific Health States: Results from a Joint Model of Health Status and Mortality of Older Persons10aPortrait, France10aLindeboom, Maarten10aDeeg, Dorly  aFree U Amsterdam  aFree U Amsterdam and Tinbergen Institute  aFree U Amsterdam  aWith the trend toward aging, increases in health care expenditures are expected.

We apply a flexible nonparametric method--the Grade of Membership method--to a national database and summarize the multidimensional concept of health status into a limited set of interpretable indices. We then use these indices in our panel data model for health status and mortality.

True e[subscript 0] was within the ex ante 95% probability interval 97% of the time overall, but intervals were too broad up to 40 years and too narrow after 50 years. Projections to 1998 made after 1945 always contain errors of less than two years. Hypothetical projections for France, Sweden, Japan, and Canada would have done well. Changing age patterns of mortality decline over the century pose problems for the method. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.; Japan; Canada; France; Sweden  aMortality  aJournal Article  g38g4h537-49tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0591112&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200101696naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450066001661000025002321100014002575200683002716500038009546500108009926510009011006530012011096530015011216550020011367730030011568560006011868560196011929030018013880591113  a200201       200111                        eng     aEP5589883  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1410aEducation and Survival: Birth Cohort, Period, and Age Effects10aLauderdale, Diane S.  aU Chicago  aPrevious studies have found that educational differences in mortality are weaker among the elderly. In this study I examine whether either cohort or period effects may have influenced the interpretation of age effects. Six 10-year birth cohorts are followed over 30 years through decennial censuses. Differential survival is inferred from changes in the relative proportions of a cohort in each education category as the cohort ages. In cross-section, younger persons generally show stronger education effects on survival, although this pattern is clearer for women than for men. There is evidence of period effects. Within cohorts, relative survival tends to increase with age. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aElderly  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g38g4h551-61tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0591113&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200102335naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450113001741000018002871100009003055201071003146500113013856500038014986500076015366510009016126530011016216530018016326530016016506530012016666530013016786530012016916550020017037730030017238560006017538560196017599030018019550591114  a200201       200111                        eng     aEP5589884  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aI12  aJ1313aThe Misuse of Biology in Demographic Research on Racial/Ethnic Differences: A Reply to van den Oord and Rowe10aFrank, Reanne  aU TX  aIn an article in the August 2000 issue of Demography titled "Racial Differences in Birth Health Risk: A Quantitative Genetic Approach," van den Oord and Rowe attempted to study the genetic and environmental factors contributing to the black/white gap in infant birth weight. Their findings indicate that this difference may be explained by shared environmental influences rather than by fetal genes. Yet the authors insisted in their conclusions that a strong genetic component still must play a role in determining the racial gap in birth weight, if only through maternal effects. The incompatibility between the authors findings and their conclusions is due largely to a weakness in their conceptualization of the relationship between race and biology. Their insistence that racial groups represent discrete genetic entities, coupled with a failure to account for interactions between biological and environmental processes, illustrates the methodological and ethical problems that threaten future interdisciplinary research on racial/ethnic disparities in health. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Demographics  a Demography  a Health  a Infants  a Racial  aJournal Article  g38g4h563-67tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0591114&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200102304naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450070001741000019002441100036002635201004002996500113013036500038014166500076014546510009015306530011015396530018015506530016015686530015015846530012015996530015016116530010016266530012016366550020016487730030016688560006016988560196017049030018019000591115  a200201       200111                        eng     aEP5589885  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aI12  aJ1310aOne Step Back in Understanding Racial Differences in Birth Weight10aZuberi, Tukufu  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aIn recognition of the biological and social connections in demographic processes, demographers have integrated biological factors into their models of population variation. This new effort has tended to focus on the analysis of fertility and mortality. Edwin J. C. G. van den Oord and David C. Rowe's article, "Racial Differences in Birth Health Risk: A Quantitative Genetic Approach," published in the August 2000 issue of Demography, is part of this effort. These authors use race as a proxy for genetic variation, which subverts even the most positive attempts to understand the impact of genetic variation on demographic processes. The authors' statistical results restate their anachronistic theory of race using latent variables that are not open to empirical testing. Although new data increase the opportunities for the examination of the relationship between biology and demographic processes researchers must be vigilant not to commit the errors of the past by misusing race as a variable. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Demographics  a Demography  a Fertility  a Health  a Mortality  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g38g4h569-71tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0591115&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200101960naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450126001741000033003007000019003331100068003527100009004205200639004296500113010686500038011816500076012196510009012956530011013046530013013156530012013286550020013407730030013608560006013908560196013969030018015920591116  a200201       200111                        eng     aEP5589886  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aI12  aJ1311aA Step in Another Direction: Looking for Maternal Genetic and Environmental Effects on Racial Differences in Birth Weight10avan den Oord, Edwin J.

These effects present a set of risk factors that are largely unrelated to those that are presently under investigation and fail to explain the gap in birth weight; empirical findings suggest their involvement. Although maternal effects can be environmental, as illustrated by recent findings, genetic effects could be important as well because gene frequencies are known to differ across the "racial" groups as studied by birth weight researchers, and maternal genes can exert a causal effect on birth weight. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Infants  a Racial  aJournal Article  g38g4h573-76tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0591116&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200101875naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450099001661000023002651100053002885200836003416500042011776500113012196510009013326550020013417730030013618560006013918560196013979030016015930587106  a200111       200108                        eng     aEP5132351  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ1513aThe Educational Enrollment of Immigrant Youth: A Test of the Segmented-Assimilation Hypothesis10aHirschman, Charles  aCenter for Studies in Demography & Ecology, U WA  aAn analysis of 1990 census data on the educational enrollment of 15- to 17-year-old immigrants to the United States provides partial support for predictions from both the segmented-assimilation hypothesis and the immigrant optimism hypothesis. Most immigrant adolescents, especially from Asia, are as likely as their native-born peers to be enrolled in high school, or more so. The "at-risk" immigrant youths with above-average levels of nonenrollment that are not reduced with longer exposure to American society are primarily of Hispanic Caribbean origins (from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba). Recent Mexican immigrants who arrived as teenagers have nonenrollment rates over 40%, but Mexican youths who arrived at younger ages are only somewhat less likely to be enrolled in school than are native-born Americans. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g38g3h317-36tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0587106&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200102269naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450116001741000021002907000023003111100014003347100024003485200898003726500113012706500172013836500102015556510009016576530009016666550020016757730030016958560006017258560196017319030016019270587107  a200111       200108                        eng     aEP5132352  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aR23  aR2110aDifferences in the Locational Attainment of Immigrant and Native-Born Households with Children in New York City10aRosenbaum, Emily10aFriedman, Samantha  aFordham U  aGeorge Washington U  aIn this paper we use a data set created especially for New York City to evaluate whether the locational attainment of households with children, as indicated by the context of the neighborhoods in which they live, varies by their immigrant status. In addition, we evaluate whether the relationship between immigrant status and neighborhood conditions varies by the householder's race/ethnicity. Overall, when compared with native-born households with children, immigrant households with children live in neighborhoods of lower quality, characterized by higher teenage fertility rates and higher percentages of students in local schools scoring below grade level in math and of persons receiving AFDC, but lower rates of juvenile detention. Further analyses, however, revealed that race/ethnicity is far more potent than immigrant status per se in predicting where households with children live. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand         b(R21)  aU.S.  aRace  aJournal Article  g38g3h337-48tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0587107&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200102603naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001742450093001821000018002757000014002937000022003071100017003297100017003467100017003635201165003806500077015456500113016226500065017356500083018006510009018836530018018926530015019106530012019256550020019377730030019578560006019878560196019939030016021890587108  a200111       200108                        eng     aEP5132353  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ15  aJ61  aJ2410aHow Enduring Were the Inequalities among European Immigrant Groups in the United States?10aAlba, Richard10aLutz, Amy10aVesselinov, Elena  aSUNY, Albany  aSUNY, Albany  aSUNY, Albany  aA long-standing and unresolved issue in the study of racial and ethnic groups concerns the persistence of initial inequalities among groups. Recently it has surfaced again in the study of U.S. immigrant groups, in George Borjas's (1994) claim that the human capital differences among early-twentieth-century immigrant groups are reflected in the relative socioeconomic achievements of their third generations. Reexamining this claim, we find that Borjas's analysis hinges on a series of problematic decisions, such as his inclusion of non-European groups as well as his failure to take ethnically mixed ancestry into account and to compensate for the weak correspondence in eastern Europe between ethnic ancestry and the national frontiers of the early 1900s. We replicate a portion of his analysis, correcting for these problems. Our results reveal no correspondence between the literacy of the first generation and the educational attainment of the third among European groups. Borjas's analysis seems to go farthest astray in including non-Europeans, especially Mexicans, because of the more systematic legal and social liabilities suffered by these groups. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24)  aU.S.  aHuman Capital  a Immigrant  a Racial  aJournal Article  g38g3h349-56tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0587108&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200101663naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450066001661000022002321100023002545200624002776500113009016500083010146510009010976530011011066550020011177730030011378560006011678560196011739030016013690587109  a200111       200108                        eng     aEP5132354  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aJ2410aLong-Run Convergence of Ethnic Skill Differentials, Revisited10aBorjas, George J.  aHarvard U and NBER  aIn my original study, "Long-Run Convergence of Ethnic Skill Differentials," I concluded that the ethnic differentials introduced by the Great Migration seemed to persist into the second and third generations.

Recent immigration has contributed moderately to national growth in males' earnings inequality, primarily by changing the composition of the population. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aEarnings  a Inequality  a Population  a Regional  a Wage  aJournal Article  g38g3h363-73tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0587110&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200102030naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450072001741000017002467000018002631100020002817100020003015200715003216500077010366500117011136500113012306510009013436530011013526530015013636530009013786530013013876550020014007730030014208560006014508560196014569030016016520587111  a200111       200108                        eng     aEP5132356  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aI38  aJ1510aImmigrants' Welfare Use and Opportunity for Contact with Co-ethnics10aHao, Lingxin10aKawano, Yukio  aJohns Hopkins U  aJohns Hopkins U  aIn this article we examine the relationship between immigrants' welfare use and their social capital, using the 1990 census.

Major findings are that the effects of social capital differ between immigrant single-mother families and elderly units; the effects of social capital differ between the young-at-arrival elderly and the old-at-arrival elderly; and the process of AFDC use is similar for immigrants and for natives, whereas the process of SSI use is more complicated for immigrants than for natives. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Immigrant  a SSI  a Welfare  aJournal Article  g38g3h375-89tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0587111&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200102206naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450090001741000023002647000020002871100018003077100024003255200858003496500077012076500083012846500113013676510011014806530011014916530019015026530015015216530015015366530012015516550020015637730031015838560006016148560196016209030016018160587112  a200111       200108                        eng     aEP5132357  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ24  aJ1511aA Model of Destination-Language Acquisition: Application to Male Immigrants in Canada10aChiswick, Barry R.10aMiller, Paul W.  aU IL, Chicago  aU Western Australia  aWe develop a model using human capital theory and an immigrant adjustment process to generate hypotheses on the acquisition of destination-language skills among immigrants. The model is tested for adult male immigrants in the 1991 Census of Canada. Use of English or French is greater, the younger the age at migration, the longer the duration of residence, the higher the educational attainment, the farther the country of origin from Canada, and the linguistically closer the mother tongue to English or French, and among those who are not refugees, those from a former British, French, or American colony, and those who live in an area where fewer people speak the respondent's mother tongue. The explanatory variables based on birthplace have behavioral interpretations and possess almost as much explanatory power as the birthplace dummy variables. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aCanada  aCensus  a Human Capital  a Immigrant  a Migration  a Skills  aJournal Article  g38g3h391-409tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0587112&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200101831naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001502450155001581000019003131100017003325200825003496500077011746510017012516530016012686530013012846550020012977730030013178560006013478560196013539030016015490587113  a200111       200108                        eng     aEP5132358  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1110aCircular, Invisible, and Ambiguous Migrants: Components of Difference in Estimates of the Number of Unauthorized Mexican Migrants in the United States10aBean, Frank D.  aU CA, Irvine  aBased on an equation that can be used with available data and that provides a basis for facilitating decomposition analyses, this research estimates that about 2.54 million total (as opposed to enumerated) unauthorized Mexicans resided in the United States in 1996. Comparing this figure with an estimate of about 2.70 million released by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) during the 1990s, we find that the two estimates involve different assumptions about circular, invisible, and ambiguous migrants. Such differences not only can have important policy implications; they can also be sizable and can operate in opposite directions, as illustrated by findings from a components-of-difference analysis. The results are also extrapolated to 2000, and implications for 2000 census counts are discussed. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.; Mexico  aImmigration  a Migrant  aJournal Article  g38g3h411-22tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0587113&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200101871naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450070001661000022002367000024002581100067002827100009003495200657003586500076010156500084010916510009011756530013011846530018011976530014012156530012012296530012012416550020012537730030012738560006013038560196013099030016015050587114  a200111       200108                        eng     aEP5132359  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1210aChanges in Children's Time with Parents: United States, 1981-199710aSandberg, John F.10aHofferth, Sandra L.  aPopulation Studies Center, Institute for Social Research, U MI  aU MD  aIn this paper we examine changes in the time American children spent with their parents between 1981 and 1997, and the contribution to these changes made by shifting patterns of female labor force participation, family structure, and parental education.

In general, children's time with parents did not decrease over the period; in two-parent families it increased substantially. Population-level changes in demographic characteristics exerted only small direct effects on the time children spent with parents. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Demographics  a Families  a Family  a Parent  aJournal Article  g38g3h423-36tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0587114&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200101883naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001502450126001581000020002847000022003047000028003261100049003547100023004037100009004265200748004356500076011836510009012596530016012686530017012846550020013017730030013218560006013518560196013579030016015530587115  a200111       200108                        eng     aEP5132360  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aSibling, Peer, Neighbor, and Schoolmate Corrections as Indicators of the Importance of Context for Adolescent Development10aDuncan, Greg J.10aBoisjoly, Johanne10aHarris, Kathleen Mullan  aInstitute for Policy Reseach, Northwestern U  aU Quebec, Rimouski  aU NC  aWe use nationally representative data to calculate correlations in achievement and delinquency between genetically differentiated siblings within a family, between peers as defined by adolescents' "best friend" nominations, between schoolmates living in the same neighborhood, and between grademates within a school.

Peer-based correlations are considerably larger than grademate and neighbor correlations but not larger than most sibling correlations.

Examination of intermarried couples' characteristics reveals (1) that intermarriages and endogamous marriages follow different patterns, and (2) that intermarriage pairings for some groups reflect a generalized racial status hierarchy. According to evidence from the 1990 U.S. Census PUMS, patterns in blacks' and Mexican Americans' marriages with whites suggest that a generalized racial status hierarchy disadvantages members of these minority groups. For marriages between Japanese Americans and whites, however, crossing the group boundary does not affect couples' characteristics. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aMarriage  a Racial  aJournal Article  g38g2h147-59tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0574921&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200101595naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450088001661000026002541100015002805200538002956500084008336500113009176510009010306530013010396550020010527730030010728560006011028560196011089030013013040574922  a200108       200105                        eng     aEP5213652  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1513aThe Salience of Pan-national Hispanic and Asian Identities in U.S. Marriage Markets10aRosenfeld, Michael J.  aStanford U  aIn this paper I test whether "Hispanic" and "Asian" identities are salient in the U.S. marriage market.

In addition, we distinguish women and men. Descriptive statistics indicate that West Indians, with the exception of men who arrived as adults, are more likely than African Americans to have white partners. After the introduction of controls for several correlates of intermarriage, however, West Indian men of any generation have lower exogamy rates than African American men, while exogamy rates are higher among West Indian women who arrived as children or who were born in the United States than among African American women. Thus we find no consistent evidence of greater exogamy for British West Indians than for African Americans. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g38g2h177-85tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0574923&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200102529naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001742450073001821000022002557000023002771100036003007100036003365201115003726500077014876500109015646500066016736500065017396510017018046530011018216530015018326530019018476530011018666550020018777730031018978560006019288560196019349030013021300574924  a200108       200105                        eng     aEP5213655  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aO15  aJ16  aJ6110aOn the Auspices of Female Migration from Mexico to the United States10aCerrutti, Marcela10aMassey, Douglas S.  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aIn this paper we examine the circumstances and determinants of female migration between Mexico and the United States. Using data from the Mexican Migration Project, we considered the relative timing of males' and females' moves northward. We then estimated logit and probit models to study the determinants of male and female out-migration; among women we also estimated a multinomial logit model to uncover differences in the process of migration for work versus not for work. We found that women almost always followed other family members, either the husband or a parent; only a tiny minority initiated migration independently. Although males also are quite likely to be introduced to migration by a parent, nearly half of all male migrants left for the United States before or without a wife or a parent. Estimates of the determinants of migration suggested that males move for employment, whereas wives generally are motivated by family reasons. Daughters, however, display a greater propensity to move for work, and the determinants of their work-related moves closely resemble those of sons and fathers. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.; Mexico  aFemale  a Migration  a Out Migration  a Women  aJournal Article  g38g2h187-200tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0574924&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200102021naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450095001661000016002611100017002775201001002946500065012956500066013606510015014266530014014416530011014556550020014667730030014868560006015168560196015229030013017180574925  a200108       200105                        eng     aEP5213656  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ61  aJ1611aA Cross-National Comparison of the Impact of Family Migration on Women's Employment Status10aBoyle, Paul  aU St Andrews  aIn this paper we consider the effects of family migration on women's employment status, using census microdata from Great Britain and the United States. We test a simple hypothesis that families tend to move long distances in favor of the male's career and that this can have a detrimental effect on women's employment status. Unlike many previous studies of this question, our work emphasizes the importance of identifying couples that have migrated together, rather than simply comparing long-distance (fe)male migrants with nonmigrant (fe)males individually. We demonstrate that women's employment status is harmed by family migration; the results we present are surprisingly consistent for Great Britain and the United States, despite differing economic situations and cultural norms regarding gender and migration. We also demonstrate that studies that fail to identify linked migrant couples are likely to underestimate the negative effects of family migration on women's employment status. 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.K.; U.S.  aMigration  a Women  aJournal Article  g38g2h201-13tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0574925&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200102340naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001742450051001821000016002331100062002495200972003116500038012836500064013216500108013856500073014936510009015666530011015756530018015866530013016046530017016176530017016346530012016516530014016636550020016777730030016978560006017278560196017339030013019290574926  a200108       200105                        eng     aEP5213657  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aH51  aJ14  aI1810aIncreasing Longevity and Medicare Expenditures10aMiller, Tim  aCenter for the Econ & Demography of Aging, U CA, Berkeley  aOfficial Medicare projections forecast that the elderly population will be less healthy and more costly over the next century. This prediction stems from the use of age as an indicator of health status: increases in longevity are assumed to increase demand for health care as individuals survive to older and higher-use ages. In this paper I suggest an alternative approach, in which time until death replaces age as the demographic indicator of health status. Increases in longevity are assumed to postpone the higher Medicare use and costs associated with the final decade of life. I contrast the two approaches, using mortality forecasts consistent with recent projections from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Social Security Administration. The time-until-death method yields significantly lower-cost forecasts. The hypothetical cost savings from improved health are small, however, relative to the size of the Medicare solvency problem caused by population aging. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aNational Government Expenditures and Health         b(H51) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Demographics  a Elderly  a Expenditure  a Health Care  a Health  a Medicare  aJournal Article  g38g2h215-26tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0574926&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200102086naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450146001741000025003201100009003455200739003546500113010936500038012066500172012446510009014166530011014256530016014366530015014526530016014676550020014837730030015038560006015338560196015399030013017350574927  a200108       200105                        eng     aEP5213658  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aI12  aR2310aInequality in Life Expectancy, Functional Status, and Active Life Expectancy across Selected Black and White Populations in the United States10aGeronimus, Arline T.  aU MI  aWe calculated population-level estimates of mortality, functional health, and active life expectancy for black and white adults living in a diverse set of 23 local areas in 1990, and nationwide. At age 16, life expectancy and active life expectancy vary across the local populations by as much as 28 and 25 years respectively. The relationship between population infirmity and longevity also varies. Rural residents outlive urban residents, but their additional years are primarily inactive. Among urban residents, those in more affluent areas outlive those in high-poverty areas. For both whites and blacks, these gains represent increases in active years. For whites alone they also reflect reductions in years spent in poor health. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aHealth  a Inequality  a Mortality  a Population  aJournal Article  g38g2h227-51tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0574927&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200102272naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001742450074001821000027002567000019002831100028003027100037003305200904003676500066012716500109013376500076014466500038015226510014015606530011015746530010015856530015015956530011016106550020016217730030016418560006016718560196016779030013018730574928  a200108       200105                        eng     aEP5213659  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aO15  aJ13  aI1210aWomen's Health and Pregnancy Outcomes: Do Services Make a Difference?10aFrankenberg, Elizabeth10aThomas, Duncan  aRAND Corp, Santa Monica  aRAND Corp, Santa Monica and UCLA  aWe use data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey to investigate the impact of a major expansion in access to midwifery services on health and pregnancy outcomes for women of reproductive age. Between 1990 and 1998 Indonesia trained some 50,000 midwives. Between 1993 and 1997 these midwives tended to be placed in relatively poor communities that were relatively distant from health centers. We show that additions of village midwives to communities between 1993 and 1997 are associated with a significant increase in body mass index in 1997 relative to 1993 for women of reproductive age, but not for men or for older women. The presence of a village midwife during pregnancy is also associated with increased birthweight. Both results are robust to the inclusion of community-level fixed effects, a strategy that addresses many of the concerns about biases because of nonrandom program placement. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aIndonesia  aHealth  a Poor  a Pregnancy  a Women  aJournal Article  g38g2h253-65tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0574928&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200102371naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450063001741000018002377000017002557000022002721100026002947100033003207100045003535200911003986500109013096500076014186500119014946510015016136530013016286530019016416530019016606530018016796530011016976550020017087730030017288560006017588560196017649030013019600574929  a200108       200105                        eng     aEP5213660  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aO15  aJ13  aO1810aSavings/Credit Group Formation and Change in Contraception10aSteele, Fiona10aAmin, Sajeda10aNaved, Ruchira T.  aLondon School of Econ  aPopulation Council, New York  aSave The Children USA, Dhaka, Bangladesh  aWe examine the characteristics of women who chose to join a women's savings or credit group organized by Save the Children USA in a rural area of Bangladesh, and the impact of participation on contraceptive use. The data are taken from a panel survey conducted in 1993, shortly before the groups were formed, and in 1995 after interventions began. Our findings show that although demographic and socioeconomic characteristics have only a weak relationship to the decision to join a program, the treatment that a woman receives from her husband is associated with participation. We also find evidence that the credit program tends to attract women who are already using contraception. The analysis of program impact on the use of modern contraceptives reveals a positive effect of the credit program, after we adjust for this selectivity; we see no evidence of an effect of participation in a savings group. 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18)  aBangladesh  aChildren  a Contraception  a Contraceptive  a Demographics  a Rural  aJournal Article  g38g2h267-82tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0574929&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200102425naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450089001741000022002637000018002851100017003037100012003205200989003326500084013216500113014056500166015186510009016846530015016936530014017086530013017226530014017356530013017496530012017626550020017747730030017948560006018248560196018309030013020260574930  a200108       200105                        eng     aEP5213661  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ15  aN3113aThe Influence of Remarriage on the Racial Difference in Mother-Only Families in 191010aLondon, Andrew S.10aElman, Cheryl  aKent State U  aU Akron  aHistorical demography documents that mother-only families were more common among African Americans than among Euro-Americans early in the twentieth century. We find direct evidence that African American males in both first and higher-order marriages were more likely to have (re)married previously married women and were more likely to have (re)married women with children. This racial difference in (re)marital partner choice reduced the racial difference in the prevalence of mother-only families such that, in the absence of such remarriage choices, the prevalence of mother-only families in the turn-of-the-century African American population would have been even higher than has been reported. Remarriage in this period countered the various demographic, economic, cultural, and social-institutional forces that disproportionately destabilized African American marriages; it must be taken into account more fully by analysts concerned with racial differences in family structure. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31)  aU.S.  aDemography  a Families  a Marital  a Marriage  a Mothers  a Racial  aJournal Article  g38g2h283-97tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0574930&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200102315naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001502450096001581000022002547000031002761100060003077100019003675201263003866500076016496510009017256530010017346530015017446550020017597730031017798560006018108560196018169030013020120574931  a200108       200105                        eng     aEP5213662  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1311aAvailability of Child Care in the United States: A Description and Analysis of Data Sources10aGordon, Rachel A.20aChase-Lansdale, P.

In this paper we describe and evaluate several indicators of child care availability that have been released by the U.S. Census Bureau over the last 15 years. Using community- and individual-level analyses, we find that these data sources are useful for indicating childcare availability within communities, even though they were collected for other purposes. Furthermore, our results generally suggest that the data on childcare availability are equally valid across communities of different urbanicity and average income levels, although it appears that larger geographic areas more accurately capture the childcare market of centers than that of family day care providers. Our analyses indicate that center childcare is least available in nonmetropolitan, poor communities, and that family day care is most available in nonmetropolitan, mixed-income communities. We discuss the benefits and limitations of the data sources, and point to directions for future data developments and research. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Childcare  aJournal Article  g38g2h299-316tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0574931&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aMay 200101767naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001502450053001581000023002117000022002341100050002567100050003065200763003566500076011196530011011956530015012066550020012217730028012418560006012698560196012759030018014710561434  a200105       200102                        eng     aEP4143209  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aVariance Effects in the Bongaarts-Feeney Formula10aKohler, Hans-Peter10aPhilipov, Dimiter  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research  aBongaarts and Feeney have recently proposed an adjusted total fertility rate to disentangle tempo effects from changes in the quantum of fertility. We propose an extension to the Bongaarts and Feeney formula that includes variance effects: that is, changes in the variance of the fertility schedule over tune. If these variance effects are ignored, the mean age at birth and the adjusted total fertility rate are biased. We provide approximations for these biases, and we extend the TFR adjustment to fertility schedules with changing variance. We apply our method to the Swedish baby boom and bust, and show that variance effects are important for evaluating the relative contributions of tempo and quantum effects to the fertility change from 1985 to 1995. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aBirths  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g38g1h1-16tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0561434&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200101854naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001502450118001581000013002767000021002891100066003107100043003765200810004196500076012296530014013056550020013197730029013398560006013688560196013749030018015700561435  a200105       200102                        eng     aEP4143210  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1311aA Sensitivity Analysis of the Bongaarts-Feeney Method for Adjusting Bias in Observed Period Total Fertility Rates10aYi, Zeng10aLand, Kenneth C.  aDuke U, Peking U, and Max Planck Instiute for Demographic Res  aCenter for Demographic Studies, Duke U  aOur sensitivity analysis shows that the adjusted TFR-prime(t) using the formula of Bongaarts and Feeney (1998), which assumes an invariant shape for the fertility schedule, usually does not differ significantly from an adjusted TFR-double-prime(t) that allows the shape of the fertility schedule to change at a constant annual rate. Because annual changes in the shape of the fertility schedules often are approximately constant except in abnormal conditions, the Bongaarts-Feeney (B-F) method is generally robust for producing reasonable estimates of the adjusted TFR-prime(t). The adjusted TFR-prime(t) neither represents any real cohort experiences from the past nor forecasts any future trend. It merely provides an improved reading of the period fertility measure, which reduces the tempo distortion. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aFertility  aJournal Article  g38g1h17-28tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0561435&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200101702naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001502450097001581000024002551100009002795200709002886500076009976510012010736530013010856530016010986530015011146530014011296550020011437730029011638560006011928560196011989030018013940561436  a200105       200102                        eng     aEP4143211  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aBehavior Genetic Modeling of Human Fertility: Findings from a Contemporary Danish Twin Study10aRodgers, Joseph Lee  aU OK  aBehavior genetic designs and analyses can be used to address issues of central importance to demography. We use this methodology to document genetic influence on human fertility. Our data come from Danish twin pairs born from 1953 to 1959, measured on age at first attempt to get pregnant (FirstTry) and number of children (NumCh). Behavior genetic models were fitted using structural equation modeling and DF analysis. A consistent medium-level additive genetic influence was found for NumCh, equal across genders; a stronger genetic influence was identified for FirstTry, greater for females than for males. A bivariate analysis indicated significant shared genetic variance between NumCh and FirstTry. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aDenmark  aChildren  a Demography  a Fertility  a Pregnant  aJournal Article  g38g1h29-42tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0561436&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200102011naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450103001661000023002697000021002927000022003131100050003357100036003857100009004215200746004306500076011766500109012526510010013616530018013716530015013896550020014047730029014248560006014538560196014599030018016550561437  a200105       200102                        eng     aEP4143212  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO1513aThe Density of Social Networks and Fertility Decisions: Evidence from South Nyanza District, Kenya10aKohler, Hans-Peter10aBehrman, Jere R.10aWatkins, Susan C.  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aU PA  aDemographers have argued increasingly that social interaction is an important mechanism for understanding fertility behavior. Yet it is still quite uncertain whether social learning or social influence is the dominant mechanism through which social networks affect individuals' contraceptive decisions. In this paper we argue that these mechanisms can be distinguished by analyzing the density of the social network and its interaction with the proportion of contraceptive users among network partners. Our analyses indicate that social learning is most relevant with high market activity; in regions with only modest market activity, however, social influence is the dominant means by which social networks affect women's contraceptive use. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aKenya  aContraceptive  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g38g1h43-58tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0561437&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200101959naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450116001661000020002821100037003025200831003396500084011706500077012546530011013316530018013426530014013606530014013746550020013887730029014088560006014378560196014439030018016390561438  a200105       200102                        eng     aEP4143213  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1110aIncreasing Fertility in Cohabiting Unions: Evidence for the Second Demographic Transition in the United States?10aRaley, R. Kelly  aPopulation Research Center, U TX  aAs cohabitation becomes increasingly common and accepted, one might expect the meaning of this arrangement to change. In some countries in Europe (e.g., Sweden), as cohabitation became more prevalent, it moved from a deviant status to an acceptable alternative to marriage. Will the same thing happen in the United States? To investigate this question, I examine increases in the proportion of births occurring in cohabiting unions, using data from the 1987-1988 National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) and the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). The standardization and decomposition procedure shows that most of the growth in the proportion of births to cohabitors is the result of increases in the proportion of women cohabiting, rather than changes in union formation behaviors surrounding pregnancies. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aBirths  a Demographics  a Families  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g38g1h59-66tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0561438&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200102203naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450112001741000021002867000017003077000022003241100037003467100068003837100015004515200791004666500109012576500066013666500052014326510010014846530014014946530017015086530012015256530011015376550020015487730029015688560006015978560196016039030018017990561439  a200105       200102                        eng     aEP4143215  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aO15  aJ16  aI1110aDimensions of Women's Autonomy and the Influence on Maternal Health Care Utilization in a North Indian City10aBloom, Shelah S.10aWypij, David10aDas Gupta, Monica  aCarolina Population Center, U NC  aHarvard School of Public Health and Children's Hospital, Boston  aWorld Bank  aThe dimensions of women's autonomy and their relationship to maternal health care utilization were investigated in a probability sample of 300 women in Varanasi, India. We examined the determinants of women's autonomy in three areas: control over finances, decision-making power, and freedom of movement. After we control for age, education, household structure, and other factors, women with closer ties to natal kin were more likely to have greater autonomy in each of these three areas. Further analyses demonstrated that women with greater freedom of movement obtained higher levels of antenatal care and were more likely to use safe delivery care. The influence of women's autonomy on the use of health care appears to be as important as other known determinants such as education. 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11)  aIndia  aEducation  a Health Care  a Health  a Women  aJournal Article  g38g1h67-78tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0561439&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200101828naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450098001661000020002647000020002841100043003047100043003475200696003906500038010866500077011246510009012016530020012106530015012306550020012457730029012658560006012948560196013009030018014960561440  a200105       200102                        eng     aEP4143216  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1110aReconsidering Mortality Compression and Deceleration: An Alternative Model of Mortality Rates10aLynch, Scott M.10aBrown, J.

Our model fits mortality data well across all adult ages 20-105 for 1968-1992 U.S. white data, and the results offer some confirmation of findings of mortality research using conventional methods. We find that the age at which mortality deceleration begins is increasing over time, that decompression of mortality is occurring, and that these trends vary substantially across genders, although male and female mortality patterns appear to be converging to some extent. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aMortality Rates  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g38g1h79-95tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0561440&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200102122naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450065001661000017002311100036002485200971002846500077012556500113013326510009014456530011014546530012014656530012014776530016014896530021015056550020015267730030015468560006015768560196015829030018017780561441  a200105       200102                        eng     aEP4143217  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ1510aNew African American Life Tables from 1935-1940 to 1985-199010aElo, Irma T.  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aNew life tables for African Americans are presented from 1935 through 1990. They are based on a historical series of vital statistics data on deaths that have been corrected for age misreporting, on reconstructed population counts that have been adjusted for census underenumeration, and on births that have been corrected for underregistration. The new life tables show rapid mortality declines for both African American males and females from 1935 to 1950, and relatively steady reductions thereafter for females. The smaller declines in male mortality in young adulthood and middle age since the 1950s have led to exceptionally high ratios of male to female mortality at these ages. Corrections for census undercounts lead to higher values of life expectancy than in official life tables, but to less improvement over time.

In Indian data this index is robust to the assets included, and produces internally coherent results. State-level results correspond well to independent data on per capita output and poverty. To validate the method and to show that the asset index predicts enrollments as accurately as expenditures, or more so, we use data sets from Indonesia, Pakistan, and Nepal that contain information on both expenditures and assets. The results show large, variable wealth gaps in children's enrollment across Indian states. On average a "rich" child is 31 percentage points more likely to be enrolled than a "poor" child, but this gap varies from only 4.6 percentage points in Kerala to 38.2 in Uttar Pradesh and 42.6 in Bihar. 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24)  aIndia  aPoverty  aJournal Article  g38g1h115-32tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0561442&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200102211naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450082001741000019002567000022002751100014002977100014003115200861003256500065011866500172012516500113014236510009015366530014015456530017015596530015015766550020015917730030016118560006016418560196016479030018018430561443  a200105       200102                        eng     aEP4143219  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ61  aR23  aJ1513aThe Impact of Immigration on the Internal Migration of Natives and Immigrants10aKritz, Mary M.10aGurak, Douglas T.  aCornell U  aCornell U  aIn this paper we examine the internal migratory response, by native-born non-Hispanic white men and foreign-born men in the United States, to recent immigration. Our analysis does not support the claim that natives have made a migratory response to recent Immigration. Native-born men and foreign-born men were less likely to leave states that received large numbers of immigrants in the 1980s than they were to leave other states, and native-born men had less propensity toward out-migration than did foreign-born men. Out-migration was most likely to be deterred if recent immigrants originated in Europe or Asia. Although native-born non-Hispanic white men showed a tendency toward out-migration if recent immigrants originated in Latin America or the Caribbean, this result was insignificant after we controlled for state economic and regional context. 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  a Immigration  a Migration  aJournal Article  g38g1h133-45tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0561443&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aFebruary 200102353naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450090001741000024002641100056002885201087003446500076014316500066015076500084015736510009016576530014016666530014016806530014016946530012017086530013017206550020017337730030017538560006017838560196017899030018019850556511  a200103       200011                        eng     aEP3932891  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ16  aJ1210aMaternal Employment and Time With Children: Dramatic Change or Surprising Continuity?10aBianchi, Suzanne M.  aCtr on Population, Gender & Social Inequality, U MD  aDespite the rapid rise in mothers' labor force participation, mothers' time with children has tended to be quite stable over time. In the past, non-employed mothers' time with children was reduced by the demands of unpaid family work and domestic chores and by the use of mother substitutes for childcare, especially in large families. Today employed mothers seek ways to maximize time with children: They remain quite likely to work part-time or to exit from the labor force for some years when their children are young; they also differ from non-employed mothers in other uses of time (housework, volunteer work, leisure). In addition, changes in children's lives (e.g., smaller families, the increase in preschool enrollment, the extended years of financial dependence on parents as more attend college) are altering the time and money investments that children require from parents. Within marriage, fathers are spending more time with their children than in the past, perhaps increasing the total time children spend with parents even as mothers work more hours away from home. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aChildcare  a Children  a Families  a Family  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g37g4h401-14tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0556511&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200002139naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450076001661000019002421100014002615201002002756500065012776500172013426510009015146530013015236530021015366530010015576550020015677730030015878560006016178560196016239030018018190556512  a200103       200011                        eng     aEP3932892  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ31  aR2310aExplaining Levels of Within-Group Wage Inequality in U.S. Labor Markets10aMcCall, Leslie  aRutgers U  aMost research on earnings inequality has focused on the growing gap between workers of different races and at different education, age, and income levels, but a large portion of the increasing inequality has actually occurred within these groups. This article focuses on the extent and sources of "within-group" wage inequality in more than 500 labor markets in the United States in 1990. In addition to documenting that within-group wage inequality across regions varies more widely today than over the past several decades, the analysis reveals that two frequently cited explanations of rising wage inequality over time have little impact on within-group wage inequality when measured at the local labor market level: (1) industrial shifts and (2) increased technology and trade. By contrast, flexible and insecure employment conditions (e.g., unemployment, contingent work, and immigration) are associated strongly with high local levels of within-group wage inequality, especially among women. 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aEarnings  a Wage Inequality  a Wage  aJournal Article  g37g4h415-30tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0556512&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200002320naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450091001741000015002657000028002801100009003087100009003175201128003266500076014546500056015306500042015866510009016286530011016376530011016486530015016596530014016746550020016887730030017088560006017388560196017449030018019400556513  a200103       200011                        eng     aEP3932893  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aI32  aI2113aThe Mechanisms Mediating the Effects of Poverty on Children's Intellectual Development10aGuo, Guang10aHarris, Kathleen Mullan  aU NC  aU NC  aAlthough adverse consequences of poverty for children are documented widely, little is understood about the mechanisms through which the effects of poverty disadvantage young children. In this analysis we investigate multiple mechanisms through which poverty affects a child's intellectual development. Using data from the NLSY and structural equation models, we have constructed five latent factors (cognitive stimulation, parenting style, physical environment, child's ill health at birth, and ill health in childhood) and have allowed these factors, along with child care, to mediate the effects of poverty and other exogenous variables. We produce two main findings. First, the influence of family poverty on children's intellectual development is mediated completely by the intervening mechanisms measured by our latent factors. Second, our analysis points to cognitive stimulation in the home, and (to a lesser extent) to parenting style, physical environment of the home, and poor child health at birth, as mediating factors that are affected by lack of income and that influence children's intellectual development. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Child  a Childhood  a Children  aJournal Article  g37g4h431-47tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0556513&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200002599naa  2200445   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001740430008001822450058001901000015002487000020002631100014002837100014002975200988003116500172012996500056014716500081015276500113016086500061017216510011017826530011017936530012018046530016018166530010018326530016018426530012018586530013018706550020018837730030019038560006019338560196019399030018021350556514  a200103       200011                        eng     aEP3932894  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aR23  aI32  aR12  aJ15  aR5813aThe Spatial Separation of the Poor in Canadian Cities10aFong, Eric10aShibuya, Kumiko  aU Toronto  aU Toronto  aWe used the 1991 Canadian census to examine the extent of spatial separation of the poor in Canadian cities. Although there were no extensive areas of blight, decay, or housing abandonment, we found high spatial separation of poor visible minorities in the selected cities. The index of dissimilarity indicates high segregation of poor blacks and moderate separation of poor Asians from the non-poor population. We tested the effects of three major structural factors--racial and ethnic segregation, income segregation, and urban redevelopment--and found that racial and ethnic residential patterns are related strongly to the spatial separation of poor persons. The relationship between income segregation and spatial separation of the poor is not significant, however. We also found that the relationship between urban redevelopment and spatial separation of the poor pertains only to blacks. These findings suggest that blacks are vulnerable in the process of urban redevelopment. 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aSize and Spatial Distributions of Regional Economic Activity         b(R12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aRegional Development Planning and Policy         b(R58)  aCanada  aCensus  a Cities  a Minorities  a Poor  a Population  a Racial  a Spatial  aJournal Article  g37g4h449-59tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0556514&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200002000naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450124001741000021002987000025003191100045003447100045003895200697004346500063011316500081011946500076012756510009013516530017013606530015013776550020013927730030014128560006014428560196014489030018016440556515  a200103       200011                        eng     aEP3932895  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aQ24  aR12  aQ2810aDemographics of Dumping II: A National Environmental Equity Survey and the Distribution of Hazardous Materials Handlers10aDavidson, Pamela10aAnderton, Douglas L.  aSocial & Demographic Research Inst, U MA  aSocial & Demographic Research Inst, U MA  aUsing a national survey of facilities governed by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), we examine the sociospatial distribution of a much larger group of hazardous materials handlers than did previous environmental equity studies. Overall we find that RCRA-governed facilities are more likely to be sited in working-class neighborhoods with lower percentages of minority residents. We do not find evidence of stark environmental inequities. RCRA-facilities, however, are close to neighborhoods with a higher percentage of minority residents. And in non-metropolitan areas, they are slightly more likely to be located in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of black residents. 4aRenewable Resources and Conservation: Land         b(Q24) 4aSize and Spatial Distributions of Regional Economic Activity         b(R12) 4aRenewable Resources and Conservation: Government Policy         b(Q28)  aU.S.  aConservation  a Resources  aJournal Article  g37g4h461-66tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0556515&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200002068naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001742450066001821000022002481100037002705200699003076500166010066500038011726500076012106500113012866510009013996530010014086530015014186530015014336550020014487730030014688560006014988560196015049030018017000556516  a200103       200011                        eng     aEP3932896  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aN31  aI12  aJ13  aJ1510aIntra-ethnic Diversity in Hispanic Child Mortality, 1890-191010aGutmann, Myron P.  aPopulation Research Center, U TX  aUsing a representative sample of the Hispanic population of the United States based on the manuscripts of the 1910 census, we estimate childhood mortality for the period from approximately 1890 to 1910.

Child mortality was very high among Hispanic residents of New Mexico and those in Florida outside Tampa; it was especially low in the Hispanic population in Tampa. 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aChild  a Childhood  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g37g4h467-75tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0556516&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200001989naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450064001741000021002387000018002597000018002771100034002957100018003297100018003475200680003656500066010456500109011116500076012206510010012966530011013066530012013176530016013296550020013457730030013658560006013958560196014019030018015970556517  a200103       200011                        eng     aEP3932897  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aO15  aJ1310aUnderstanding the Sex Ratio in India: A Simulation Approach10aGriffiths, Paula10aMatthews, Zoe10aHinde, Andrew  aCarolina Population Ctr, U NC  aU Southampton  aU Southampton  aThe highly masculine sex ratio in India has increased substantial in the twentieth century, in contrast to most other countries in tire world. Competing arguments alternatively posit underenumeration, highly masculine sex ratios at birth, or excess female mortality throughout the life course as the factors underlying the level of the overall sex ratio; these arguments have not been resolved. Based oil population projections that simulate population dynamics, our findings show that small differences in mortality at young ages, persisting over a long period, as well as a sex ratio at birth of 106 males per 100 females, result in a highly masculine population sex ratio. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aIndia  aBirths  a Female  a Population  aJournal Article  g37g4h477-88tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0556517&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200001970naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450099001661000020002657000024002857000023003091100037003327100037003697100037004065200715004436500076011586500038012346510009012726530011012816530018012926530013013106530015013236550020013387730030013588560006013888560196013949030018015900556518  a200103       200011                        eng     aEP3932898  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aI1210aDemographic Models of Birth Outcomes and Infant Mortality: An Alternative Measurement Approach10aSolis, Patricio10aPullum, Starling G.10aFrisbie, W.

We propose an alternative strategy, which relies on continuous measures of birth outcomes, identifies an optimal combination of birth weight and gestational age for infant survival, and estimates the effects of adverse birth outcomes in terms of their departure from this "optimal point." We illustrate the advantages of this approach by estimating a logistic model using data from the 1989-1991 NCIIS linked birth/infant death files. Finally, we discuss future applications and methodological issues to be resolved in subsequent research. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Demographics  a Infants  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g37g4h489-98tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0556518&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200001564naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450070001661000023002361100009002595200605002686500042008736500077009156510009009926530014010016550020010157730031010358560006010668560196010729030018012680556519  a200103       200011                        eng     aEP3932899  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ1110aForecasting Enrollments for Immigrant Entry-Port School Districts10aMorrison, Peter A.  aRAND  aThis paper projects school enrollments in Santa Ana, California and evaluates the accuracy of the projections.

In this study I followed a sample of men from age 18 to first marriage and ultimately to death. Health in early adulthood was represented by height and weight around age 20. The probability of ever marrying and the conditional probability of marriage in a given time period were lower for smaller men and greater for larger men. Marriage significantly lowered mortality risk even after controlling for health in early adulthood. Thus 1 found support both for selection into marriage and for protective effects of marriage. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Health  a Marital  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g37g4h511-21tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0556520&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200001804naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450076001661000022002421100009002645200741002736500066010146500076010806510009011566530011011656530018011766530015011946530011012096550020012207730030012408560006012708560196012769030018014720556521  a200103       200011                        eng     aEP3932902  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aJ1310aDiverging Fertility among U.S. Women Who Delay Childbearing Past Age 3010aMartin, Steven P.  aU MD  aIn this paper 1 examine the evolving association between eduational attainment and the timing of births. In the late 1970s, women with four-year college degrees had lower first birth rates before age 30 than women with less education, but rates of first births were similar for the two groups after age 30. From the 1970s to the 1990s, first birth rates decreased before age 30 for all women, but increased after age 30 only for women with four-year college degrees. Parity 2 birth rates also increased for college graduates with a first birth after age 30. These results document widening educational differences infertility timing between 1975 and 1995, which may reflect period changes at later ages in women's work and family lives. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Childbearing  a Fertility  a Women  aJournal Article  g37g4h523-33tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0556521&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aNovember 200001927naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450173001661000023003397000021003621100043003837100011004265200661004376500108010986500077012066510009012836530012012926530013013046530016013176550020013337730030013538560006013838560196013899030016015850540235  a200011       200008                        eng     aEP3589665  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ14  aJ1111aActive Life Expectancy Estimates for the U.S. Elderly Population: A Multidimensional Continuous-Mixture Model of Function Change Applied to Completed Cohorts, 1982-199610aManton, Kenneth G.10aLand, Kenneth C.  aCentre for Demographic Studies, Duke U  aDuke U  aAn increment-decrement stochastic-process life table model that continuously mixes measures of functional change is developed to represent age transitions among highly refined disability states interacting simultaneously with mortality.

At age 76 at Wave 1, there was a racial crossover in the cumulative number of six potentially fatal diagnoses (chronic lung disease, cancer, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke) from a higher cumulative average number for blacks to a higher average number for whites. Also, there was a racial crossover at age 86 in the cumulative average number of disabilities in the Advanced Activities of Daily Living (AADLs), from a higher average for blacks to a higher average for whites. Between Waves 1 and 2, there was a racial crossover in the odds of mortality from higher odds for blacks to higher odds for whites; this occurred at about age 81. The results are consistent with the interpretation that the racial crossover in comorbidity (but not the crossover in AADL disability) propelled the racial crossover in mortality. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aCancer  a Disability  a Disease  a Health  a Heart Disease  a Mortality  a Racial  aJournal Article  g37g3h267-83tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0540236&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200001892naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450077001741000033002517000019002841100014003037100009003175200677003266500113010036500038011166500076011546510009012306530011012396530012012506530012012626550020012747730030012948560006013248560196013309030016015260540237  a200011       200008                        eng     aEP3589667  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aI12  aJ1310aRacial Differences in Birth Health Risk: A Quantitative Genetic Approach10avan den Oord, Edwin J.

Rather than trying to measure all relevant variables, we used a genetically informative design to study the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors. Employing multiple indicators of "birth health risk," we found that the racial differences increased with the magnitude of the shared environmental effects. This suggested that possible genetic effects would not pertain to fetal genes, although genes affecting the mother's physical or physiological characteristics could be important because they contribute to shared environment in our analysis. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Health  a Racial  aJournal Article  g37g3h285-98tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0540237&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200002253naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450126001741000027003007000022003271100015003497100036003645200872004006500076012726500109013486500066014576510009015236530013015326530019015456530019015646530015015836530012015986550020016107730031016308560006016618560196016679030016018630540238  a200011       200008                        eng     aEP3589668  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO15  aJ1610aHusbands' versus Wives' Fertility Goals and Use of Contraception: The Influence of Gender Context in Five Asian Countries10aMason, Karen Oppenheim10aSmith, Herbert L.  aWorld Bank  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aUsing data from Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines, we explore how gender context influences (1) husband-wife concordance in the demand for children and (2) the impact of each spouse's fertility preferences on contraceptive use. We also explore whether the husband's pronatalism can explain the wife's unmet need for contraception. The results suggest that gender context has little net effect on couples concordance, but influences the relative weight of husband's and wive's preferences in determining contraceptive use. Analysis of women's unmet need for contraception suggests that the husband's pronatalism contributes to wife's unmet need, but only to a relatively small degree, especially in settings where unmet need is high. This is the case because the proportion of couples with differing fertility goals is small in most communities. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aAsia  aChildren  a Contraception  a Contraceptive  a Fertility  a Gender  aJournal Article  g37g3h299-311tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0540238&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200002238naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450132001741000017003067000016003231100036003397100058003755200793004336500076012266500109013026500066014116510052014776530017015296530012015466530015015586530012015736530011015856550020015967730030016168560006016468560196016529030016018480540239  a200011       200008                        eng     aEP3589669  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO15  aJ1610aDoes Female Circumcision Affect Infertility and Fertility?

In all three countries, however, circumcised women grouped by age at circumcision did not have significantly diffe rent odds of infertility nor of having a child than did uncircumcised women, when the effects of covariates were controlled. Thus we find evidence suggesting that the practice of female circumcision does not have a statistically discernible effect on women's ability to reproduce. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aCentral African Republic; Ivory Coast; Tanzania  aDemographics  a Female  a Fertility  a Health  a Women  aJournal Article  g37g3h313-21tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0540239&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200002200naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450102001741000019002767000022002951100015003177100015003325200906003476500076012536500065013296500109013946510016015036530010015196530013015296530015015426530013015576550020015707730030015908560006016208560196016269030016018220540240  a200011       200008                        eng     aEP3589670  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ61  aO1510aFrom Austerity to Prosperity?

We use the 1990 Census Public Use Microdata Samples for the United States and Puerto Rico to demonstrate the benefits of a comparative approach that includes data from both the origin and the destination. Specifically the primary objective is to determine how and why the risk of child poverty is associated with migration from Puerto Rico to the United States. The results show that migration reduces the risk of child poverty, partly because better jobs are available on the mainland. Employment, human capital, family structure, and public assistance cannot completely explain observed differences. The results also show that the economic benefits of migration continue for the native-born on the mainland and that return migration to Puerto Rico is associated with impoverishment. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aPuerto Rico  aChild  a Migrant  a Migration  a Poverty  aJournal Article  g37g3h323-38tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0540240&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200001891naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450059001661000024002257000022002491100015002717100015002865200836003016500044011376500065011816510009012466530014012556530013012696530015012826550020012977730030013178560006013478560196013539030016015490540241  a200011       200008                        eng     aEP3589671  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aF22  aJ6110aYou Can Go Home Again: Evidence from Longitudinal Data10aReagan, Patricia B.10aOlsen, Randall J.  aOH State U  aOH State U  aIn this paper we analyze the economic and demographic factors that influence return migration, focusing on generation 1.5 migrants. Using longitudinal data from the 1979 youth cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys (NLSY79), we track residential histories of young immigrants to the United States and analyze the covariates associated with return migration to their home country. Overall, return migration appears to respond to economic incentives, as well as to cultural and linguistic ties to the United States and the home country. We find no role for welfare magnets in the decision to return, but we learn that welfare participation leads to lower probability of return migration. Finally, we see no evidence of a skill bias in return migration, where skill is measured by performance on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  a Migrant  a Migration  aJournal Article  g37g3h339-50tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0540241&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200002604naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001660430008001742450138001821000021003207000017003417000026003581100015003847100014003997100012004135201193004256500113016186500077017316500042018086500092018506510009019426530011019516550020019627730030019828560006020128560196020189030016022140540242  a200011       200008                        eng     aEP3589672  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aJ11  aI21  aR1313aThe Changing Structure of School Segregation: Measurement and Evidence of Multiracial Metropolitan-Area School Segregation, 1989-199510aReardon, Sean F.10aYun, John T.10aEitle, Tamela McNulty  aPA State U  aHarvard U  aU Miami  aIn this paper we examine aggregate patterns and trends in segregation among white (non-Hispanic), black, Hispanic, and Asian public school students in 217 metropolitan areas during the period 1989-1995. We first describe a set of methodological tools that enable us both to measure the mutual segregation among multiple racial groups and to partition total metropolitan-area school segregation into geographic and racial components. Then we use these tools to examine patterns and trends in metropolitan-area school segregation. We find that the average levels of multiracial school segregation have been unchanged from 1989 to 1995, but that this stability masks important shifts in the geographic and racial components making up average levels of total metropolitan school segregation. In particular, segregation between non-Hispanic white students and all other students has increased, on average, while segregation among black, Hispanic, and Asian student groups has declined. In addition, the contribution to average levels of total metropolitan segregation due to between-district segregation has grown, whereas the relative contribution of within-district segregation has declined. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aGeneral Equilibrium and Welfare Economic Analysis of Regional Economies         b(R13)  aU.S.  aRacial  aJournal Article  g37g3h351-64tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0540242&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200002169naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450099001741000019002737000020002921100009003127100009003215200783003306500069011136500077011826500084012596530017013436530018013606530012013786530022013906530010014126530025014226530012014476530016014596530016014756550020014917730030015118560006015418560196015479030016017430540243  a200011       200008                        eng     aEP3589673  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD31  aJ11  aJ1210aGrowth in Family Income Inequality, 1970-1990: Industrial Restructuring and Demographic Change10aChevan, Albert10aStokes, Randall  aU MA  aU MA  aIndustrial restructuring and changing population composition frequently have been treated as competing explanations of growing U.S. income inequality. Using the Gini coefficient, we employ a model of conditional change to explore the relative effects of each on changes of family income distribution between 1970 and 1990, across 784 metropolitan areas and public use microdata areas (PUMAs). Changes in both industrial structure and population characteristics are found to have significant and opposite effects on family income distribution, although there are sharp differences by decade in the dynamics that underlie increasing inequality. Our central conclusion is that it is too soon to eliminate deindustrialization as a significant cause of increased earnings inequality. 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aDemographics  a Distribution  a Family  a Gini Coefficient  a Gini  a Income Distribution  a Income  a Inequality  a Population  aJournal Article  g37g3h365-80tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0540243&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200002362naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001582450085001661000023002517000018002747000021002921100053003137100017003667100036003835201065004196500113014846500077015976510009016746530011016836530016016946530010017106530012017206550020017327730030017528560006017828560196017889030016019840540244  a200011       200008                        eng     aEP3589674  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aJ1113aThe Meaning and Measurement of Race in the U.S. Census: Glimpses into the Future10aHirschman, Charles10aAlba, Richard10aFarley, Reynolds  aCenter for Studies in Demography & Ecology, U WA  aSUNY, Albany  aPopulation Studies Center, U MI  aThe 1996 Racial and Ethnic Targeted Test (RAETT) was a "mail-out mail-back" household survey with an experimental design of eight alternative questionnaire formats containing systematic variations in race, instructions, question order, and other aspects of the measurement. The eight different questionnaires were administered to random subsamples of six "targeted" populations: geographic areas with ethnic concentrations of whites, blacks, American Indians, Alaskan natives, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics. The major conclusion is that allowing multiple responses to the "race" question in the 2000 census (and other variations in measurement that were considered in RAETT) had only a slight impact on the measured racial composition of the population. Another finding was a dramatic reduction in nonresponse to the combined race/Hispanic-origin question relative to all other questionnaire formats. We conclude that the concept of "origins" may be closer to the popular understanding of American diversity than is the antiquated concept of race. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Population  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g37g3h381-93tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0540244&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200001563naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190160014000630220013000770370060000900430008001500430008001580430008001662450116001741000021002901100035003115200376003466500084007226500056008066500053008626510009009156530012009246530021009366530012009576550020009697730030009898560006010198560196010259030016012210540245  a200011       200008                        eng     aEP3589675  a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aH55  aC8313aThe Accuracy of Survey-Reported Marital Status: Evidence from Survey Records Matched to Social Security Records10aWeaver, David A.  aSocial Security Administration  aResearchers have concluded that divorced persons often fail to report accurate marital information in surveys.

I offer some suggestions on how surveys can be improved. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aSocial Security and Public Pensions         b(H55) 4aSurvey Methods; Sampling Methods         b(C83)  aU.S.  aMarital  a Social Security  a Survey  aJournal Article  g37g3h395-99tDemography  iY  aPDF Availableuhttp://content.epnet.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=0540245&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4yOvqOLCmr0yeprVSsam4TLeWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMOzprkixrbNIuePfgeyx%2BEu3q64A&D=eoh  aAugust 200001578naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450121001441000015002651100043002805200825003236500077011486510009012256530017012346530016012516550020012677730030012878560006013179030013013230540224  a200011       200005                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1110aDemographics of the Gay and Lesbian Population in the United States: Evidence from Available Systematic Data Sources10aBlack, Dan  aCenter for Policy Research, Syracuse U  aThis work provides an overview of standard social science data sources that now allow some systematic study of the gay and lesbian population in the United States. For each data source, we consider how sexual orientation can be defined, and we note the potential sample sizes. We give special attention to the important problem of measurement error, especially the extent to which individuals recorded as gay and lesbian are indeed recorded correctly. Our concern is that because gays and lesbians constitute a relatively small fraction of the population, modest measurement problems could lead to serious errors in inference. In examining gays and lesbians in multiple data sets we also achieve a second objective: We provide a set of statistics about this population that is relevant to several current policy debates. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Population  aJournal Article  g37g2h139-54tDemography  iN  aMay 200001790naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450052001681000024002201100022002445200711002666500059009776500056010366500109010926500064012016510009012656530016012746530026012906530017013166530016013336530022013496550020013717730030013918560006014219030013014270540225  a200011       200005                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD12  aI32  aO15  aE2110aMeasuring Living Standards with Proxy Variables10aMontgomery, Mark R.  aSUNY, Stony Brook  aVery few demographic surveys in developing countries have gathered information on household incomes or consumption expenditures. Researchers interested in living standards therefore have had little alternative but to rely on simple proxy indicators. The properties of these proxies have not been analyzed systematically. We ask what hypotheses can be tested using proxies, and compare these indicators with consumption expenditures per adult, our preferred measure of living standards. We find that the proxies employed in much demographic research are very weak predictors of consumption per adult. Nevertheless, hypothesis tests based on proxies are likely to be powerful enough to warrant consideration. 4aConsumer Economics: Empirical Analysis         b(D12) 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aMacroeconomics: Consumption; Saving; Wealth         b(E21)  aLDCs  aConsumption  a Developing Countries  a Expenditure  a Households  a Living Standards  aJournal Article  g37g2h155-74tDemography  iN  aMay 200001813naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450084001441000018002287000023002467000020002691100036002897100036003257100036003615200964003976500108013616510009014696550020014787730030014988560006015289030013015340540226  a200011       200005                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1411aAge Reporting among White Americans Aged 85+: Results of a Record Linkage Study10aHill, Mark E.10aPreston, Samuel H.10aRosenwaike, Ira  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aThis study investigates age reporting on the death certificates of older white Americans. We link a sample of death certificates for native-born whites aged 85+ in 1985 to Social Security Administration records and to records of the U.S. censuses of 1900, 1910, and 1920. When ages in these sources are compared, inconsistencies are found to be minimal, even beyond age 95. Results show little distortion and no systematic biases in the reported age distribution of deaths. To explore the effect of age misreporting on old-age mortality, we estimate "corrected" age-specific death rates by the extinct-generation method for the U.S. white cohort born in 1885. With few exceptions, corrected and uncorrected rates in single years differ by less than 3% and are not systematically biased. When we compare corrected rates with those for the same birth cohort in France, Japan, and Sweden, we find that white American mortality at older ages is exceptionally low. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g37g2h175-86tDemography  iN  aMay 200001696naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450082001521000022002347000025002567000024002811100009003057100015003147100015003295200751003446500077010956500076011726510009012486530011012576530018012686530015012866550020013017730030013218560006013519030013013570540227  a200011       200005                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ1310aCombining Registration-System and Survey Data to Estimate Birth Probabilities10aHandcock, Mark S.10aHuovilainen, Sami M.10aRendall, Michael S.  aU WA  aPA State U  aPA State U  aWith the widespread availability of event-history data, demographers have increasingly eschewed registration-system data in favor of survey data. We propose instead using survey and registration-system data in combination, via a constrained maximum-likelihood framework for demographic hazard modeling. As an application, we combine panel survey data and birth registration data to estimate annual birth probabilities by parity. The general fertility rate obtained from registration-system data constrains the weighted sum of parity-specific birth probabilities. The variances about the parity-specific birth probabilities are halved when registration-system data are used to constrain the estimates. Other demographic applications are discussed. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.K.  aBirths  a Demographics  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g37g2h187-92tDemography  iN  aMay 200001717naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450080001521000022002327000017002547000021002711100054002927100034003467100020003805200761004006500077011616500081012386510009013196530017013286550020013457730031013658560006013969030013014020540228  a200011       200005                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aC1011aA Note on the Measurement of Accuracy for Subnational Demographic Estimates10aSwanson, David A.10aTayman, Jeff10aBarr, Charles F.  aHelinski School of Econ & Business Administration  aSan Diego Assn of Governments  aU NV, Las Vegas  aMean absolute percentage error (MAPE), the measure most often used for evaluating subnational demographic estimates, is not always valid. We describe guidelines for determining when MAPE is valid. Applying them to case study data, we find that MAPE understates accuracy because it is unduly influenced by outliers. To overcome this problem, we calculate a transformed MAPE (MAPET) using a modified Box-Cox method. Because MAPE-T is not in the same scale as the untransformed absolute percentage errors, we provide a procedure for calculating MAPE-R, a measure in the same scale as the original observations. We argue that MAPE-R is a more appropriate summary measure of average absolute percentage error when the guidelines indicate that MAPE is not valid. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconometric and Statistical Methods and Methodology: General         b(C10)  aU.S.  aDemographics  aJournal Article  g37g2h193-201tDemography  iN  aMay 200001649naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450092001521000019002441100009002635200801002726500076010736500048011496510009011976530018012066530011012246530014012356530013012496530016012626550020012787730030012988560006013289030013013340540229  a200011       200005                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aI3110aChild Support and the Postdivorce Economic Well-Being of Mothers, Fathers, and Children10aBartfeld, Judi  aU WI  aThis article provides national estimates of the current and potential impact of private child support transfers on the economic well-being of custodial and noncustodial families following marital dissolution. Mothers and children fare dramatically worse than fathers after marital dissolution; these differences, however, would be much more pronounced in the absence of private child support. Simulations of four existing child support guidelines show that substantial increases in economic well-being among mother-custody families are possible within the structure of the existing child support system, with minimal impact on poverty among nonresident fathers. Under all of these guidelines, however, custodial-mother families would continue to fare substantially worse than nonresident fathers. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31)  aU.S.  aChild Support  a Child  a Children  a Mothers  a Well Being  aJournal Article  g37g2h203-13tDemography  iN  aMay 200001926naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001600430008001682450053001761000013002297000015002421100011002577100060002685200572003286500084009006500119009846500109011036500155012126500092013676510010014596530012014696530014014816550020014957730030015158560006015459030013015510540230  a200011       200005                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aO18  aO15  aP36  aR1310aRegional Analysis of Divorce in China since 198010aZeng, Yi10aWu, Deqing  aDuke U  aInst Pop Res, Peking U and Max Planck Inst for Demo Res  aThis paper estimates and discusses divorce measures in China and its 30 provinces since 1980.

Unlike researchers in earlier studies, we find no evidence that the effect of income became stronger over the period. Changes in age, race, immigrant status, schooling, and completed fertility explain a relatively small share of the changes in living arrangements. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aSocial Security and Public Pensions         b(H55)  aU.S.  aElderly  a Social Security  aJournal Article  g37g2h221-36tDemography  iN  aMay 200001461naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450069001441000021002137000021002341100066002557100038003215200698003596500084010576510009011416550020011507730030011708560006012009030013012060540232  a200011       200005                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aHow does POSSLQ Measure Up?

We compare our new estimates with those produced by the traditional method and evaluate the new estimates. We then compare the indirect estimates with the new direct estimates to investigate whether biases exist in the indirect estimates. Our findings indicate that the traditional indirect method of estimating cohabitation prevalence underestimates cohabitors in different subpopulations, especially among those with children. We also find that the new indirect measure produces relatively unbiased estimates of cohabitors "characteristics." 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g37g2h237-45tDemography  iN  aMay 200001508naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450084001681000021002521100035002735200544003086500084008526500052009366500108009886500038010966530015011346550020011497730030011698560006011999030013012050540233  a200011       200005                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aI11  aJ14  aI1210aCommentary on 'A Methodology for Identifying Married Couples on Medicare Data.'10aKestenbaum, Bert  aSocial Security Administration  aAuthors of an article appearing recently in Demography propose a retrospective method to identify husband-wife pairs in administrative records.

A retrospective look four years after the reference date shows that the number of pairs is increased by less than 10%, not by more than 50%, as the authors claim. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aDemography  aJournal Article  g37g2h247-49tDemography  iN  aMay 200000909naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450084001681000026002521100014002786500084002926500052003766500038004286500108004666550020005747730030005948560006006249030013006300540234  a200011       200005                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aI11  aI12  aJ1410aRefinements of a Methodology for Detecting Married Couples in the Medicare Data10aIwashyna, Theodore J.  aU Chicago 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aAnalysis of Health Care Markets         b(I11) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aJournal Article  g37g2h251-52tDemography  iN  aMay 200002017naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450069001601000023002291100009002525201156002616500038014176500077014556500109015326510012016416530014016536550020016677730028016878560006017159030018017210540214  a200011       200002                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ11  aO1510aSocioeconomic Background and War Mortality during Vietnam's Wars10aMerli, M. Giovanna  aU WI  aTo understand the experience of North Vietnamese soldiers and civilians during the American war, I explore the paths leading Vietnamese men into battle by considering the relationship between socioeconomic status and war mortality. I use data obtained from retrospective information on kin survival and other socioeconomic characteristics given by respondents in the 1995 Vietnam Longitudinal Survey conducted in Vietnam's Red River Delta. My findings are opposite to those often cited to describe the experience of young Americans who fought in the Vietnam war. In Vietnam, sons of better-educated fathers bore the burden of war disproportionately in relation to sons of fathers with less education, both in proportion serving in the military and in diminished survival chances in combat. The Vietnamese experience during the American war testifies to the ability of a nation to reorder society temporarily and to persuade higher-status groups to contribute fully to the war effort. An appreciation of the meaning of this social reshuffling during the American war is critical for understanding the war, Vietnam, and that country's political outlook. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aVietnam  aMortality  aJournal Article  g37g1h1-15tDemography  iN  aFebruary 200001496naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450075001601000018002351100016002535200556002696500109008256500108009346500077010426510014011196530012011336550020011457730029011658560006011949030018012000540215  a200011       200002                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aO15  aJ14  aJ1113aThe Residency Decision of Elderly Indonesians: A Nested Logit Analysis10aCameron, Lisa  aU Melbourne  aThis paper is the first study of which the author is aware that examines elderly Indonesians' residency decisions.

Most work on this subject, however, focuses on one type of market condition--sex ratios--and on a single outcome--marital timing or sorting. We examine the impact of local marriage markets' educational composition on educational assortative mating and on how sorting varies with age. We estimate a discrete-time competing-risks model of educational sorting outcomes, using individual data from the NLSY and community descriptors aggregated from census microdata. Results show that residents of educationally less favorable marriage markets are more likely to marry down on education, and that (for women) their chance of doing so increases with age more than for residents of more favorable markets. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Marital  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g37g1h29-40tDemography  iN  aFebruary 200001887naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450106001601000021002667000018002877000021003051100009003267100009003357100013003445200826003576500113011836500077012966500041013736510009014146530019014236530010014426530012014526550020014647730029014848560006015139030018015190540217  a200011       200002                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aJ11  aJ7113aThe Declining Significance of Race among American Men during the Latter Half of the Twentieth Century10aSakamoto, Arthur10aWu, Huei-Hsia10aTzeng, Jessie M.  aU TX  aU TX  aMcGill U  aThe extent to which racial minority groups face discrimination in the labor market is the subject of considerable debate. Using William J. Wilson's thesis of the declining significance of race as our theoretical context, we provide further empirical evidence about labor market discrimination by investigating wages among African American, American Indian, Chinese American, Hispanic white, Japanese American, and non-Hispanic white men. We find, during the period before the civil rights movement, that a substantively significant wage disadvantage is evident for these minority groups with controls for observed labor force characteristics. In recent data, these net disadvantages are reduced substantially for each of these groups except Hispanics. With the exception of Hispanics, the results support Wilson's thesis. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71)  aU.S.  aDiscrimination  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g37g1h41-51tDemography  iN  aFebruary 200001559naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450084001521000019002361100008002555200735002636500108009986500038011066510009011446530012011536530019011656530024011846550020012087730029012288560006012579030018012630540218  a200011       200002                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ14  aI1210aUnderstanding the Twentieth-Century Decline in Chronic Conditions among Old Men10aCosta, Dora L.  aMIT  aI argue that the shift from manual to white-collar jobs and reduced exposure to infectious disease were important determinants of declines in chronic disease rates among older men from the early 1900s to the 1970s and 1980s. The average decline in chronic respiratory problems, valvular heart disease, arteriosclerosis, and joint and back problems was about 66%. Occupational shifts accounted for 29% of the decline; the decreased prevalence of infectious disease accounted for 18%; the remainder are unexplained. The duration of chronic conditions has remained unchanged since the early 1900s, but when disability is measured by difficulty in walking, men with chronic conditions are less disabled now than they were in the past. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aDisease  a Heart Disease  a Infectious Disease  aJournal Article  g37g1h53-72tDemography  iN  aFebruary 200001514naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450062001521000024002141100043002385200667002816500038009486500108009866510009010946530010011036530013011136530012011266530013011386550020011517730029011718560006012009030018012060540219  a200011       200002                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1410aObesity, Disease, and Functional Limitation in Later Life10aHimes, Christine L.  aCenter for Policy Research, Syracuse U  aLittle is known about the effects of obesity late in life.

An important contribution of our study is the use of information on siblings to control for unmeasured factors that may confound estimates of the effect of pregnancy intentions on infant and child outcomes. Results from our study indicate that unwanted pregnancy is associated with prenatal and postpartum maternal behaviors that adversely affect infant and child health, but that unwanted pregnancy has little association with birth weight and child cognitive outcomes. Estimates of the association between unwanted pregnancy and maternal behaviors were greatly reduced after controls for unmeasured family background were included in the model. Our results also indicate that there are no significant differences in maternal behaviors or child outcomes between mistimed and wanted pregnancies. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Infants  a Pregnancy  a Prenatal  a Youth  aJournal Article  g37g1h83-94tDemography  iN  aFebruary 200001465naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450072001521000019002241100023002435200663002666500076009296500109010056510010011146530013011246550020011377730030011578560006011879030018011930540221  a200011       200002                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO1510aSon Preference and Sex Composition of Children: Evidence from India10aClark, Shelley  aPopulation Council  aAlthough the effect of son preference on sex composition of children ever born is undetectable in national-level estimates that aggregate across all families, this article provides empirical evidence from India that son preference has two pronounced and predictable family-level effects on the sex composition of children ever born.

We investigate underreporting of births in four rural counties of northern China, using data from a 1992 sample survey featuring a reproductive history. To clarify the mechanisms of underreporting, we focus on the ways in which reporting errors may affect the distribution of first births by time since marriage. The results of our investigation suggest that in three of the four counties, first-birth intervals are lengthened by underreporting of girl babies and by replacing them with second births reported as first births. 4aSocialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets; Industry Studies; Population         b(P23) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aEconomic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure         b(O18) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aChina  aBirths  a Population  a Rural  aJournal Article  g37g1h109-26tDemography  iN  aFebruary 200001652naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450111001441000023002551100008002785200933002866500077012196510009012966530014013056530017013196550020013367730030013568560006013869030018013920540223  a200011       200002                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1113aThe New Immigrant Survey Pilot (NIS-P): Overview and New Findings about U.S. Legal Immigrants at Admission10aJasso, Guillermina  aNYU  aThis paper provides an overview of the New Immigrant Survey Pilot (NIS-P), a panel survey of a nationally representative sample of new legal immigrants to the United States based on probability samples of administrative records of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).

Results indicate that the procedures followed for locating, interviewing, and reinterviewing respondents yielded representative samples of new legal immigrants and high-quality data. On the basis of data obtained from the first round of the survey we present new information never before available on the schooling and language skills of new immigrants and their earnings gains from immigration. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  a Immigration  aJournal Article  g37g1h127-38tDemography  iN  aFebruary 200001883naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450083001521000023002351100020002585201017002786500084012956500076013796510009014556530013014646530018014776530012014956530012015076550020015197730030015398560006015699030018015750510862  a200004       199911                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aGoing to Extremes: Family Structure, Children's Well-Being, and Social Science10aCherlin, Andrew J.  aJohns Hopkins U  aIn this article I argue that public discussions of demographic issues are often conducted in a troubling pattern in which one extreme position is debated in relation to the opposite extreme. This pattern impedes our understanding of social problems and is a poor guide to sound public policies. To illustrate this thesis I use the case of social scientific research examining how children are affected by not living with two biological parents while they are growing up. Over the last decade, I maintain, most of the public, and even many social scientists, have been puzzled and poorly informed by this debate. In particular I consider Judith Wallerstein's clinically based claims of the pervasive, profound harm caused by divorce and, at the other extreme, Judith Rich Harris's reading of behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology, which leads her to dismiss the direct effects of divorce. Neither extreme gives a clear picture of the consequences of growing up in a single-parent family or a stepfamily. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Demographics  a Family  a Parent  aJournal Article  g36g4h421-28tDemography  iN  aNovember 199902041naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450084001601000018002447000021002621100012002837100011002955200880003066500038011866500166012246500172013906510009015626530015015716530013015866530015015996530015016146550020016297730030016498560006016799030018016850510863  a200004       199911                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aN31  aR2310aGeographic Morbidity Differentials in the Late Nineteenth-Century United States10aElman, Cheryl10aMyers, George C.  aU Akron  aDuke U  aWe use a national cross-sectional database, the 1880 Integrated Public Use Microdata Sample, to examine aggregate patterns and individual-level estimates of chronic-disease morbidity and long-term disability in the United States in the late nineteenth century. Despite higher levels of urban mortality in 1880, morbidity prevalence rates were highest in the rural areas of the country, especially in the western and the southern regions. Equations using microdata show that the estimated risk of chronic disease and impairment was highest for males and females who were older, of lower socioeconomic status, or from rural areas. This era was marked by geographically uneven but significant levels of endemic chronic disease, likely the outcomes of prior episodes of infectious disease and exposure to conditions generated by human action, such as the Civil War and migration. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aDisability  a Disease  a Morbidity  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g36g4h429-43tDemography  iN  aNovember 199902061naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450112001521000023002647000019002871100015003067100015003215201246003366500038015826500042016206510009016626530014016716530012016856550020016977730030017178560006017479030018017530510864  a200004       199911                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aI2110aRefining the Association between Education and Health: The Effects of Quantity, Credential, and Selectivity10aRoss, Catherine E.10aMirowsky, John  aOH State U  aOH State U  aWe refine the established association between education and health by distinguishing three aspects of a person's education (quantity credential, and selectivity) and by examining the mechanisms through which they may correlate with health. Data are from the 1995 Aging, Status, and the Sense of Control Survey a representative U.S. national telephone survey of 2,593 respondents aged 18 to 95, with an oversample of elderly. Results show that physical functioning and perceived health increase significantly with years of formal education and with college selectivity for those with a bachelor's or higher degree, adjusting for age, sex, race, marital status, and parental education. The credential of a college degree has no net association with physical functioning and perceived health beyond the amount attributable to the additional years of schooling. Of the three aspects of education, years of schooling has the largest effect. Most of that association appears attributable to its correlation with work and economic conditions, social psychological resources, and health life style. A large portion of the net association of college selectivity with physical functioning and perceived health appears attributable to health lifestyle. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21)  aU.S.  aEducation  a Health  aJournal Article  g36g4h445-60tDemography  iN  aNovember 199901539naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450111001521000023002637000021002861100009003077100023003165200645003396500108009846500042010926510009011346530017011436530015011606550020011757730030011958560006012259030018012310510865  a200004       199911                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ14  aI2113aThe Role of Education in Explaining and Forecasting Trends in Functional Limitations among Older Americans10aFreedman, Vicki A.10aMartin, Linda G.  aRAND  aPopulation Council  aUsing the Survey of income and Program Participation, we document the importance of education in accounting for declines in functional limitations among older Americans from 1984 to 1993. Of the eight demographic and socioeconomic variables considered, education is most important in accounting for recent trends. The relationship between educational attainment and functioning has not changed measurably, but educational attainment has increased greatly during this period. Our analysis suggests, all else being equal, that future changes in education will continue to contribute to improvements in functioning, although at a reduced rate. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Education  aJournal Article  g36g4h461-73tDemography  iN  aNovember 199901803naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450087001601000021002477000020002681100019002887100018003075200742003256500038010676500182011056500077012876510024013646530011013886530016013996550020014157730030014358560006014659030018014710510866  a200004       199911                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aN30  aJ1110aRectangularization Revisited: Variability of Age at Death within Human Populations10aWilmoth, John R.10aHoriuchi, Shiro  aU CA, Berkeley  aRockefeller U  aRectangularization of human survival curves is associated with decreasing variability in the distribution of ages at death. This variability, as measured by the interquartile range of life table ages at death, has decreased from about 65 years to 15 years since 1751 in Sweden. Most of this decline occurred between the 1870s and the 1950s. Since then, variability in age at death has been nearly constant in Sweden, Japan, and the United States, defying predictions of a continuing rectangularization. The United States is characterized by a relatively high degree of variability, compared with both Sweden and Japan. We suggest that the historical compression of mortality may have had significant psychological and behavioral impacts. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: General, International, or Comparative         b(N30) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aJapan; Sweden; U.S.  aDeaths  a Population  aJournal Article  g36g4h475-95tDemography  iN  aNovember 199901881naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001600430008001682450073001761000018002491100009002675200897002766500038011736500051012116500113012626500066013756500042014416510009014836550020014927730031015128560006015439030018015490510867  a200004       199911                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ10  aJ15  aJ16  aI2110aMultivariate Survivorship Analysis Using Two Cross-Sectional Samples10aHill, Mark E.  aU PA  aAs an alternative to survival analysis with longitudinal data, I introduce a method that can be applied when one observes the same cohort in two cross-sectional samples collected at different points in time. The method allows for the estimation of log-probability survivorship models that estimate the influence of multiple time-invariant factors on survival over a time interval separating two samples. This approach can be used whenever the survival process can be adequately conceptualized as an irreversible single-decrement process (e.g., mortality, the transition to first marriage among a cohort of never-married individuals). Using data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (Ruggles and Sobek 1997), I illustrate the multivariate method through an investigation of the effects of race, parity, and educational attainment on the survival of older women in the United States. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Economics: General         b(J10) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g36g4h497-503tDemography  iN  aNovember 199901544naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450055001521000025002071100015002325200735002476500076009826500109010586510011011676530011011786530015011896550020012047730030012248560006012549030018012600510868  a200004       199911                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aO1510aFertility Estimation from Open Birth-Interval Data10aSchmertmann, Carl P.  aFL State U  aCensuses and surveys frequently collect information on period fertility through questions on the timing of last births.

I propose a more efficient, maximum likelihood method for estimating fertility from open-interval data. I illustrate a mathematical derivation of the new method, perform sensitivity analyses, and conduct empirical tests with Brazilian census data. The new estimators have small biases and lower variance than standard estimators for open-interval data. Consequently the new method is more likely to generate accurate results from small or moderately sized samples. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBrazil  aBirths  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g36g4h505-19tDemography  iN  aNovember 199901790naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450082001521000019002347000023002531100015002767100015002915200921003066500172012276500042013996510009014416550020014507730030014708560006015009030018015060510869  a200004       199911                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aR23  aI2110aWhy Are Residential and School Moves Associated with Poor School Performance?10aPribesh, Shana10aDowney, Douglas B.  aOH State U  aOH State U  aMost research on residential mobility has documented a clear pattern: residential and school moves are associated with poor academic performance. Explanations for this relationship, however, remain speculative. Some researchers argue that moving affects social relationships that are important to academic achievement. But the association between moving and school performance may be spurious; the negative correlation may be a function of other characteristics of people who move often. We offer several conceptual and analytical refinements to these ideas, allowing us to produce more precise tests than past researchers. Using longitudinal data, we find that differences in achievement between movers and nonmovers are partially a result of declines in social relationships experienced by students who move. Most of the negative effect of moving, however, is due to preexisting differences between the two groups. 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g36g4h521-34tDemography  iN  aNovember 199901792naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450094001521000022002467000020002687000020002881100009003087100009003177100014003265200843003406500084011836500076012676510009013436530011013526530014013636530015013776550020013927730030014128560006014429030018014480510870  a200004       199911                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aInterrelated Family-Building Behaviors: Cohabitation, Marriage, and Nonmarital Conception10aBrien, Michael J.10aLillard, Lee A.10aWaite, Linda J.  aU VA  aU MI  aU Chicago  aData from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 are used to estimate a series of models of entry into marriage, entry into cohabitation, and nonmarital pregnancy. Our models account explicitly for the endogeneity of one outcome as a predictor of another by taking into account both heterogeneity across individuals due to unmeasured factors that may affect all these outcomes and the correlation in the unmeasured factors across processes. We find that these heterogeneity components are strongly and positively related across the outcomes. Women who are more likely to cohabit, marry or become pregnant while unmarried are also more likely to do each of the others. Although black and white women differ in the likelihood of these behaviors, the interrelations of the behaviors are quite similar across groups. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aFamily  a Marriage  a Pregnancy  aJournal Article  g36g4h535-51tDemography  iN  aNovember 199902317naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450120001601000023002807000030003031100020003337100045003535201103003986500084015016500108015856500076016936510009017696530010017786530014017886530018018026530013018206530013018336530013018466530012018596550020018717730030018918560006019219030016019270502417  a199911       199908                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ14  aJ1310aParental Marital Disruption and Intergenerational Transfers: An Analysis of Lone Elderly Parents and Their Children10aPezzin, Liliana E.10aSchone, Barbara Steinberg  aJohns Hopkins U  aAgency for Health Care Policy & Research  aAlthough one of the most marked demographic trends observed over the twentieth century is the increased rate of divorce, relatively little research has explored the effects of these changing marital patterns in the context of an aging society. Using a sample of lone elderly parents and their adult children, we analyze the direct and indirect effects of marital disruption on four important dimensions of intergenerational transfers: coresidence, financial assistance, adult children's provision of informal care, and parental purchase of paid care. Our findings suggest that divorce has deleterious effects on intergenerational transfers, particularly for elderly fathers. Remarriage further reduces exchange. Our results reveal that parents engage in lower levels of transfers with stepchildren relative to biological children. Moreover, intergenerational transfers are sensitive to characteristics of biological children but not to those of stepchildren. Taken together, these results suggest that exchange at the end of the life course continues to be adversely affected by marital disruption. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAging  a Children  a Demographics  a Divorce  a Elderly  a Marital  a Parent  aJournal Article  g36g3h287-97tDemography  iN  aAugust 199901983naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450050001601000021002107000016002311100024002477100024002715200972002956500084012676500077013516500069014286510009014976530017015066530012015236530025015356530012015606550020015727730031015928560006016239030016016290502418  a199911       199908                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ11  aD3110aHave Family Income Mobility Patterns Changed?10aGittleman, Maury10aJoyce, Mary  aOECD and BLS, Paris  aBLS, Washington, DC  aWe examine the mobility of individuals in the United States based on equivalent family income--that is, total income of all family members adjusted for family size according to the equivalence scale implicit in the U.S. poverty line. Our analysis, which tracks movements across quintiles, centers on four questions: How much movement is there across the family income distribution? How has this mobility changed over time? To what extent are the movements attributable to factors related to changes in family composition versus events in the labor markets? In light of major socioeconomic changes occurring in the quarter-century under study have the determinants of mobility changed over time? Our findings indicate that mobility rates in the 1980s differed little from those in the 1970s. However, individuals in families headed by a young person or a person without a college education were less likely to experience upward mobility in the 1980s than in the 1970s. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31)  aU.S.  aDistribution  a Family  a Income Distribution  a Income  aJournal Article  g36g3h299-314tDemography  iN  aAugust 199901718naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450127001521000020002791100028002995200868003276500056011956500084012516510009013356530011013446530025013556550020013807730030014008560006014309030016014360502419  a199911       199908                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI32  aJ1210aShifting Family Definitions: The Effect of Cohabitation and Other Nonfamily Household Relationships on Measures of Poverty10aBauman, Kurt J.  aUS Bureau of the Census  aThe current official poverty measure compares income to needs within a family Some have suggested including cohabiting couples as part of this family. Others have suggested that the household be used as the unit of analysis for poverty measurement. I explore issues involved in expanding the unit of analysis, including the stability of cohabiting and other nonfamily household relationships and the degree of resource sharing that takes place among different types of people within households. Instability in households with nonfamily members is not a serious problem for inferring poverty from cross-sectional studies. On the other hand, income from people in nonfamily household roles contributes slightly less to helping other household members avoid financial hardship, implying that nonfamily housemates have a greater tendency to keep income to themselves. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aFamily  a Poverty Measurement  aJournal Article  g36g3h315-25tDemography  iN  aAugust 199901383naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450053001521000020002057000017002257000024002421100009002667100016002757100014002915200557003056500038008626500076009006510019009766530014009956550020010097730030010298560006010599030016010650502420  a199911       199908                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1310aTrajectories of Fetal Loss in the Czech Republic10aCarlson, Elwood10aHoem, Jan M.10aRychtarikova, Jitka  aU SC  aStockholm U  aCharles U  aUsing data for 555,038 pregnancies conceived in the Czech Republic in 1987-1990, we show that pronounced differences in fetal survival in the middle trimester of pregnancy by marital status, educational level, and labor force attachment become much smaller at full term; survival differences by age at conception and number of previous deliveries show relatively constant proportional hazards throughout gestation.

We argue that migration is a cumulative process with varying health effects at different stages of its progression, and test several related hypotheses. Findings suggest higher rates of infant mortality in communities experiencing intense U.S. migration. However, two factors diminish the disruptive effects of migration: migradollars, or migrant remittances to villages, and the institutionalization of migration over time. Mortality risks are low when remittances are high and decrease as migration becomes increasingly salient to livelihoods of communities. Together, the findings indicate eventual benefits to all infants, irrespective of household migration experience, as a result of the development of social and economic processes related to U.S. migration. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aMexico  aHealth  a Infants  a Migrant  a Migration  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g36g3h339-53tDemography  iN  aAugust 199901827naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450101001441000023002457000020002687000019002881100028003077100054003357100028003895200999004176500038014166510009014546530014014636550020014777730030014978560006015279030016015330502422  a199911       199908                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1213aThe Impact of Specific Occupation on Mortality in the U.S. National Longitudinal Mortality Study10aJohnson, Norman J.10aSorlie, Paul D.10aBacklund, Eric  aUS Bureau of the Census  aNational Heart, Lung, & Blood Institute, Bethesda  aUS Bureau of the Census  aWe compare mortality differences for specific and general categories of occupations using a national cohort of approximately 380,000 persons aged 25-64 from the U.S. National Longitudinal Mortality Study. Based on comparisons of relative risk obtained from Cox proportional-hazards model analyses, higher risk is observed in moving across the occupational spectrum from the technical, highly skilled occupations to less-skilled and generally more labor-intensive occupations. Mortality differences obtained for social status groups of specific occupations are almost completely accounted for by adjustments for income and education. Important differences are shown to exist for selected specific occupations beyond those accounted for by social status, income, and education. High-risk specific occupations include taxi drivers, cooks, longshoremen, and transportation operatives. Low-risk specific occupations include lawyers, natural scientists, teachers, farmers, and a variety of engineers. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aMortality  aJournal Article  g36g3h355-67tDemography  iN  aAugust 199901647naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450126001601000024002861100015003105200606003256500084009316500113010156500066011286510009011946530015012036530013012186530019012316530011012506550020012617730030012818560006013119030016013170502423  a199911       199908                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ15  aJ1610aEntry of Exit?

Higher initial entry rates among black women, especially through unpartnered childbearing, account for slightly more than half the difference between blacks and whites in the prevalence of single motherhood. The remainder of the difference is due to black single mothers' much lower rates of exit through union formation and to their very high rates of reentry through dissolution of these later unions. Entry and exit rates through the 1990s imply a widening racial gap. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aMotherhood  a Mothers  a Single Mother  a Women  aJournal Article  g36g3h369-76tDemography  iN  aAugust 199901433naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450070001441000029002141100009002435200749002526500084010016510009010856530013010946530012011076550020011197730030011398560006011699030016011750502424  a199911       199908                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aTime Spent in Parenthood Status among Adults in the United States10aKing, Rosalind Berkowitz  aU PA  aTransition rates estimated from the 1987-1988 and 1992-1994 waves of the National Survey of Families and Households imply that a U.S. adult will spend approximately one third of the years from ages 20 to 69 as a parent of a dependent child. I distinguish biological from social parenthood and provide separate estimates by gender and race. White women conform most to the conventional image of a biological parent residing with an own child, whereas African American women spend the most adult years as a parent. On average, white men spend fewer years as parents than African American men, but African American men spend more years as biological parents not residing with any children.

I use two techniques to estimate the size and heterogeneity of extended families. First, I develop a simple model that takes account only of kinship network sizes and intermarriage levels by race. This model allows a crude estimation of the frequency of multiracial kinship networks. Second, I produce more precise empirical estimates using a new hot-deck imputation method for synthesizing kinship networks from household-level survey data (the June 1990 Current Population Survey and the 1994 General Social Survey). One in seven whites, one in three blacks, four in five Asians, and more than 19 in 20 American Indians are closely related to someone of a different racial group. Despite an intermarriage rate of about 1%, about 20% of Americans count someone from a different racial group among their kin. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aRace  a Racial  aJournal Article  g36g3h399-407tDemography  iN  aAugust 199901223naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450049001441000025001931100016002185200557002346500084007916510009008756530012008846530013008966550020009097730030009298560006009599030016009650502427  a199911       199908                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1213aThe Leveling of Divorce in the United States10aGoldstein, Joshua R.  aPrinceton U  aIs the recent plateau in crude divorce rates due to compositional changes in the married population or to a fundamental change in the long-term trend of rising marital instability?

The key provision of that legislation is that after a leave of a limited duration, the recent mother is guaranteed the right to return to her preleave employer at the same or equivalent position. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we correlate work status after childbirth with work status before pregnancy to estimate the prevalence, before the legislation, of returns to the preleave employer. Among women working full-time before the pregnancy, return to the prepregnancy employer was quite common. Sixty percent of women who worked full-time before the birth of a child continued to work for the same employer after the child was born. Furthermore, the labor market behavior of most of the remaining 40% suggests that maternity-leave legislation is unlikely to have a major effect on job continuity. Compared with all demographically similar women, however, new mothers have an excess probability of leaving their jobs. 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aMaternity  a Mothers  a Pregnancy  a Youth  aJournal Article  g36g2h145-55tDemography  iN  aMay 199901712naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450073001521000015002251100015002405200984002556500053012396500076012926510009013686530012013776550020013897730030014098560006014399030013014450494389  a199908       199905                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ22  aJ1310aIs There Competition between Breast-Feeding and Maternal Employment?10aRoe, Brian  aOH State U  aTheory suggests that the decision to return to employment after childbirth and the decision to breast-feed may be jointly determined. We estimate models of simultaneous equations for two different aspects of the relationship between maternal employment and breast-feeding using 1993-1994 data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Infant Feeding Practices Study. We first explore the simultaneous duration of breast-feeding and work leave following childbirth. We find that the duration of leave from work significantly affects the duration of breast-feeding, but the effect of breast-feeding on work leave is insignificant. We also estimate models of the daily hours of work and breast-feedings at infant ages 3 months and 6 months postpartum. At both times, the intensity of work effort significantly affects the intensity of breast-feeding, but the reverse is generally not found. Competition clearly exists between work and breast-feeding for many women in our sample. 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aInfants  aJournal Article  g36g2h157-71tDemography  iN  aMay 199901921naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450077001601000019002377000018002561100009002747100034002835200919003176500069012366500084013056500066013896510009014556530011014646530012014756530016014876530011015036550020015147730030015348560006015649030013015700494390  a199908       199905                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD31  aJ12  aJ1613aThe Impact of Wives' Earnings on Income Inequality: Issues and Estimates10aCancian, Maria10aReed, Deborah  aU WI  aPublic Policy Institute of CA  aWe estimate the extent to which rising family income inequality can be explained by changes in the earnings of married women. We develop a decomposition equation that separates single persons from married couples (decomposition by population group) and, for married couples, distinguishes the impact of wives' earnings from other sources of income (decomposition by income source). Despite the rising correlation between husbands' and wives' earnings, changes in wives' earnings do not explain a substantial portion of the increase in family income inequality. Our results contradict those of some previous analyses. The inconsistency.. of recent estimates can be traced to the use of a variety of conceptually different approaches in the previous literature. We clarify these approaches by explicitly distinguishing the conceptual issues, analyzing the empirical components, and providing comprehensive estimates. 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aFamily  a Income  a Inequality  a Women  aJournal Article  g36g2h173-84tDemography  iN  aMay 199901498naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450096001521000020002487000025002681100053002937100026003465200587003726500066009596500083010256510009011086530011011176530011011286550020011397730030011598560006011899030013011950494391  a199908       199905                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aJ2413aThe Educational Attainment of Young Women: Role Model Effects of Female High School Faculty10aNixon, Lucia A.10aRobinson, Michael D.  aMathematica Policy Research, Inc, Washington, DC  aMount Holyoke College  aTo test for the presence of role model effects of female high school faculty and professional staff on young women in high school, we estimate several models of educational attainment for young women using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.

The income-to-needs levels of formerly married mothers are only 56% those of their former husbands. The postseparation gender gap is reduced if the wife was employed full-time and was an above-average earner before marital disruption. The gap is also relatively small among the least economically independent wives, those who were not employed before separation. For the latter group, the husband's relatively low income tends to reduce the gender gap. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aDivorce  a Gender  a Marital  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g36g2h195-203tDemography  iN  aMay 199901923naa  2200397   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450104001521000028002567000023002841100015003077100015003225200800003376500076011376500084012136510009012976530010013066530015013166530014013316530014013456530012013596530014013716530016013856530013014016530012014146530019014266530011014456550020014567730030014768560006015069030013015120494393  a199908       199905                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1210aLife Course Transition of American Children: Parental Cohabitation, Marriage, and Single Motherhood10aGraefe, Deborah Roempke10aLichter, Daniel T.  aPA State U  aPA State U  aWe examine the life course transitions into and from families headed by unmarried cohabiting couples for a recent cohort of American children. Life table estimates, based on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth mother-child files, indicate about one in four children will live in a family headed by a cohabiting couple sometime during childhood. Economic uncertainty is an important factor determining whether children in single-parent families subsequently share a residence with a mother's unmarried partner. Moreover virtually all children in cohabiting-couple families will experience rapid subsequent changes in family status. Our estimates provide a point of departure for future work on children's exposure to parental cohabitation and its social and economic implications. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aChild  a Childhood  a Children  a Families  a Family  a Marriage  a Motherhood  a Mothers  a Parent  a Single Parent  a Youth  aJournal Article  g36g2h205-17tDemography  iN  aMay 199901729naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450068001521000022002207000018002427000021002601100009002817100042002907100015003325200774003476500108011216500084012296510009013136530012013226530012013346550020013467730030013668560006013969030013014020494394  a199908       199905                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ14  aJ1210aTime?

We consider four demands for these resources: time spent working, time spent providing care for noncoresident elderly parents, time spent performing housework, and monetary transfers to noncoresident elderly parents. We focus on the effects of wage rates and parental characteristics on the allocation decisions of adult children and their households concerning these four demands. We find that households with individuals earning high wages rely relatively more on cash transfers and relatively less on time transfers than do lower-wage households. We also find evidence consistent with an unmeasured tendency of some families to provide multiple sources of support. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aElderly  a Parent  aJournal Article  g36g2h219-32tDemography  iN  aMay 199901702naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450058001441000023002027000023002251100014002487100009002625200958002716500065012296510017012946530014013116530017013256530013013426550020013557730030013758560006014059030013014110494395  a199908       199905                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ6113aThe New Labor Market: Immigrants and Wages after IRCA10aPhillips, Julie A.10aMassey, Douglas S.  aRutgers U  aU PA  aWe examine the effect of the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) on migrants' wages using data gathered in 39 Mexican communities and their U.S. destination areas. We examine changes in the determinants of wages before and after the passage of IRCA, as well as the effects of its massive legalization program. Migrants' wages deteriorated steadily between 1970 and 1995, but IRCA did not foment discrimination against Mexican workers per se. Rather, it appears to have encouraged greater discrimination against undocumented migrants, with employers passing the costs and risks of unauthorized hiring on to the workers. Although available data do not permit us to eliminate competing explanations entirely, limited controls suggest that the post-IRCA wage penalty against undocumented migrants did not stem from an expansion of the immigrant labor supply, an increase in the use of labor subcontracting, or a deterioration of the U.S. labor market. 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.; Mexico  aImmigrant  a Immigration  a Migrant  aJournal Article  g36g2h233-46tDemography  iN  aMay 199901585naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450085001521000024002377000024002611100012002857100012002975200688003096500076009976500061010736510013011346530013011476530018011606530015011786530009011936550020012027730030012228560006012529030013012580494396  a199908       199905                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aD7413aThe Impact of War, Famine, and Economic Decline on Marital Fertility in Ethiopia10aLindstrom, David P.10aBerhanu, Betemariam  aBrown U  aBrown U  aWe examine recent fertility trends in Ethiopia for evidence of short- and long-term responses to famine, political events, and economic decline.

In the longer term, marital fertility in both urban and rural areas declined in the 1980s after increasing moderately in the 1970s. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aConflict; Conflict Resolution; Alliances         b(D74)  aEthiopia  aChildren  a Demographics  a Fertility  a War  aJournal Article  g36g2h247-61tDemography  iN  aMay 199901745naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450101001601000026002617000024002877000019003111100019003307100009003497100009003585200688003676500038010556500076010936500084011696510009012536530010012626530015012726530012012876530015012996550020013147730030013348560006013649030013013700494397  a199908       199905                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aJ1213aThe Effect of Inbreeding on Early Childhood Mortality: Twelve Generations of an Amish Settlement10aDorsten, Linda Eberst10aHotchkiss, Lawrence10aKing, Terri M.  aSUNY, Fredonia  aU DE  aU TX  aAn unresolved issue in research on child survival is the extent to which familial mortality risk in infancy is due to biological influences net of sociodemographic and economic factors. We examine the effect of consanguinity on early childhood mortality in an Old Order Amish settlement by using the inbreeding coefficient, an explicit measure of the degree of relatedness in one's ancestry. Inbreeding has a net positive effect on neonatal and postneonatal deaths, We find social, demographic, and population-based socio-cultural explanations for this effect among the Amish population, which is known to experience certain genetically transmitted defects associated with mortality. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aChild  a Childhood  a Deaths  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g36g2h263-71tDemography  iN  aMay 199901878naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450051001521000022002031100009002255201163002346500038013976500049014356510009014846530011014936530012015046530015015166550020015317730030015518560006015819030013015870494398  a199908       199905                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aZ1210aReligious Involvement and U.S. Adult Mortality10aHummer, Robert A.  aU TX  aWe use recently released, nationally representative data from the National Health Interview Survey--Multiple Cause of Death linked file to model the association of religious attendance and sociodemographic, health, and behavioral correlates with overall and cause-specific mortality. Religious attendance is associated with U.S. adult mortality in a graded fashion: People who never attend exhibit l.87 times the risk of death in the follow-up period compared with people who attend more than once a week. This translates into a seven-year difference in life expectancy at age 20 between those who never attend and those who attend more than once a week. Health selectivity is responsible for a portion of the religious attendance effect: People who do not attend church or religious services are also more likely to be unhealthy and, consequently, to die. However religious attendance also works through increased social ties and behavioral factors to decrease the risks of death. And although the magnitude of the association between religious attendance and mortality varies by cause of death, the direction of the association is consistent across causes. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aCultural Economics: Religion         b(Z12)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Health  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g36g2h273-85tDemography  iN  aMay 199901585naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450156001521000018003081100012003265200712003386500109010506500076011596510015012356530009012506550020012597730028012798560006013079030018013130488230  a199905       199902                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aO15  aJ1310aCredit Programs for the Poor and Reproductive Behavior in Low-Income Countries: Are the Reported Causal Relationships the Result of Heterogeneity Bias?10aPitt, Mark M.  aBrown U  aGroup-based lending programs for the poor have drawn much attention recently. As many of these programs target women, an important research question is whether program participation significantly changes reproductive behavior and whether the gender of the participant matters. Using survey data from 87 Bangladeshi villages, we estimate the impact of female and male participation in group-based credit programs on reproductive behavior while attending to issues of self-selection and endogeneity We find no evidence that women's participation in group-based credit programs increases contraceptive use or reduces fertility. Men's participation reduces fertility and may slightly increase contraceptive use. 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aBangladesh  aPoor  aJournal Article  g36g1h1-21tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199902130naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450068001601000020002281100009002485201198002576500109014556500076015646500084016406510013017246530018017376530012017556550020017677730029017878560006018169030018018220488231  a199905       199902                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aO15  aJ13  aJ1210aQuality, Accessibility, and Contraceptive Use in Rural Tanzania10aMroz, Thomas A.  aU NC  aWe examine how informants' reports on community perceptions of the quality and accessibility of family planning facilities relate to the use of modern contraceptives by individuals in rural Tanzania. Using information on individual-level contraceptive use in conjunction with community-level information on the accessibility and quality of family planning facilities, we employ two distinct statistical procedures to illustrate the impacts of accessibility and quality on contraceptive use. Both procedures treat the community-level variables as imperfect indicators of characteristics of the facilities, and they yield nearly identical implications. We find that a community level, subjective perception of a family planning facility's quality has a significant impact on community members' contraceptive use whereas other community measures such as time, distance, and subjective perception of accessibility have trivial and insignificant direct impacts, net of the control variables. Future research that uncovers the determinants of perceptions of both community-level and individual-level quality could provide key insights for developing effective and efficient family planning programs. 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aTanzania  aContraceptive  a Family  aJournal Article  g36g1h23-40tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199900989naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450092001601000021002527000028002731100009003017100009003106500109003196500076004286500038005046510018005426530014005606530013005746530015005876550020006027730029006228560006006519030018006570488232  a199905       199902                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aO15  aJ13  aI1213aThe Effects of Infant Mortality on Fertility Revisited: New Evidence from Latin America10aPalloni, Alberto10aRafalimanana, Hantamala  aU WI  aU WI 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aLatin America  aFertility  a Infants  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g36g1h41-58tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199901389naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450087001521000022002397000024002611100011002857100009002965200470003056500076007756500084008516510009009356530011009446530018009556530015009736530014009886550020010027730029010228560006010519030018010570488233  a199905       199902                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1210aReexamining the Link of Early Childbearing to Marriage and to Subsequent Fertility10aMorgan, S.

In contrast, we find a weaker association between first births at young (versus older) ages and (1) a rapid pace of subsequent childbearing and (2) higher completed fertility. We discuss possible causes and consequences of these changes. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Childbearing  a Fertility  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g36g1h59-75tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199900819naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450059001521000021002117000019002321100015002517100015002666500038002816500113003196510009004326530015004416530012004566550020004687730029004888560006005179030018005230488234  a199905       199902                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1510aRacial Inequality in Active Life among Adult Americans10aHayward, Mark D.10aHeron, Melonie  aPA State U  aFL State U 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aInequality  a Racial  aJournal Article  g36g1h77-91tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199901813naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450082001601000021002427000023002631100015002867100015003015200712003166500113010286500172011416500047013136510009013606530015013696530012013846530017013966550020014137730030014338560006014639030018014690488235  a199905       199902                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aR23  aR3110aHow Low Can It Go?

The measure incorporates the way in which multiethnic contexts further constrain levels of black-white segregation. The results show that black-white desegregation is likely when the black population is small, but is unlikely otherwise. Yet, when multiple ethnic groups are sufficiently large, a moderate level of black-white segregation is necessary for whites to maintain low neighborhood contact with blacks, even when the proportion of African Americans is small. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aHousing Supply and Markets         b(R31)  aU.S.  aPopulation  a Racial  a Residential  aJournal Article  g36g1h93-109tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199901146naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450111001601000023002717000023002947000019003171100020003367100012003567100009003686500117003776500113004946500065006076510009006726530015006816530015006966530023007116550020007347730030007548560006007849030018007900488236  a199905       199902                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI38  aJ15  aJ6110aPublic Assistance Receipt among Immigrants and Natives: How the Unit of Analysis Affects Research Findings10aVan Hook, Jennifer10aGlick, Jennifer E.10aBean, Frank D.  aUrban Institute  aBrown U  aU TX 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aAssistance  a Immigrant  a Public Assistance  aJournal Article  g36g1h111-20tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199901518naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450082001441000028002267000026002547000021002801100009003017100009003107100009003195200790003286500051011186510009011696550020011787730030011988560006012289030018012340488237  a199905       199902                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1010aHow Much Do We Count?

Interpretations about the purpose and meaning of the census, about commitment to the task, and about connection to government, singly and together with literacy skills (e.g.. reading and general literacy competence), were associated with errors that are not detectable by evaluative methodologies used regularly by the Census Bureau. The validity and reliability of census data, and possibly other self-administered survey research, will be increased by greater use of knowledge about both interpretation and literacy skills in formulating data collection procedures. 4aDemographic Economics: General         b(J10)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g36g1h121-34tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199901681naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450094001521000024002461100015002705200829002856500076011146500084011906510015012746530011012896530015013006530014013156550020013297730030013498560006013799030018013850488238  a199905       199902                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1210aIncomplete Reporting of Men's Fertility in the United States and Britain: A Research Note10aRendall, Michael S.  aPA State U  aWe evaluate men's retrospective fertility histories from the British Household Panel Survey and the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID).

One third to one half of men's nonmarital births and births within previous marriages are missed in estimates from retrospective histories. Differential survey underrepresentation of previously married men compared with previously married women accounts for a substantial proportion of the deficits in previous marriage fertility. More recent retrospective histories and panel updated fertility histories improve reporting completeness, primarily by reducing the proportion of marital births from unions that are no longer intact at the survey date. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.; U.K.  aBirths  a Fertility  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g36g1h135-44tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199901073naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450069001681000026002371100013002636500065002766500066003416500109004076500172005166530011006886530015006996550020007147730025007348560006007599030018007650483173  a199902       199811                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ61  aJ16  aO15  aR2310a'Gender, Migration, and Career Trajectories in Malasia': Erratum10aChattopadhyay, Arpita  aUnlisted 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aGender  a Migration  aJournal Article  g35g4hitDemography  iN  aNovember 199801523naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450035001521000020001871100036002075200640002436500084008836500077009676530017010446530016010616530017010776530022010946530016011166530015011326550020011477730030011678560006011979030018012030483174  a199902       199811                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aQ21  aJ1110aDemography and the Environment10aPebley, Anne R.  aRAND Population Research Center  aDemographers interest in the environment has generally been enmeshed in broader issues of population growth and economic development.

One explanation proposed for this deceleration is the selective survival of healthier individuals to older ages. Data on mortality in Sweden and Japan are generally compatible with three predictions of this hypothesis.' (1) decelerations for most major causes of death; (2) decelerations starting at younger ages for more "selective" causes; and (3) a shift of the deceleration to older ages with declining levels of mortality. A parametric model employed to illustrate the third prediction relies on the distinction between senescent and background mortality. This dichotomy, though simplistic, helps to explain the observed timing of the deceleration. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aSweden; Japan  aDeaths  a Mortality  a Old Age  aJournal Article  g35g4h391-412tDemography  iN  aNovember 199801858naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450136001681000026003041100042003305200651003726500052010236500084010756500038011596500108011976510009013056530010013146530013013246530017013376530012013546530014013666530015013806530015013956550020014107730030014308560006014609030018014660483176  a199902       199811                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI11  aJ12  aI12  aJ1411aA Methodology for Identifying Married Couples in Medicare Data: Mortality, Morbidity, and Health Care Use among the Married Elderly10aIwashyna, Theodore J.  aPopulation Research Center, U Chicago  aWe describe a method for the development of cohorts of up to three quarters of the 14 million married couples aged 65 and over in the United States.

Multilevel logit models are used to evaluate the extent to which segregation of the African population into homelands gave rise to uneven patterns of contraceptive use; how this pattern was shaped by variations in family-planning acceptability; and the way in which the system of male labor migration and social and economic inequities across communities affected women's use of contraceptives. Results show that variation in contraceptive use across homeland areas diminished with the addition of community controls for development and migration. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity indicated that localized conditions could offset the advantages or disadvantages of living in a former homeland. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aSouth Africa  aContraceptive  aJournal Article  g35g4h421-34tDemography  iN  aNovember 199801888naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450086001441000022002307000024002527000021002761100040002977100040003377100040003775200966004176500076013836510009014596530017014686530014014856530013014996550020015127730030015328560006015629030018015680483178  a199902       199811                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1313aThe Long-Term Impact of Parents' Childbearing Decisions on Children's Self-Esteem10aAxinn, William G.10aBarber, Jennifer S.10aThornton, Arland  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aInstitute for Social Research, U MI  aWe examine the long-term impact of parents' childbearing decisions on children's self-esteem. We focus on subjective aspects of the home environment in the creation of children's internalized sense of self-worth. Unique 23-year family panel data combining measures of mothers' childbearing, mothers' childbearing intentions, and children's self-esteem allow us to examine the overall links between parents' childbearing and children's self-esteem. The results demonstrate that parents' childbearing intentions can have a significant long-term impact on their children's self-esteem. Children who were unintended by their mothers have significantly lower self-esteem 23 years later. Our findings indicate that giving birth to an unintended child can have a long-term negative impact on subjective aspects of the child's well-being, at least in terms of self-esteem. Unintended childbearing has received an increasing amount of research attention in recent years. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildbearing  a Children  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g35g4h435-43tDemography  iN  aNovember 199801789naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450086001521000025002387000024002637000020002871100051003077100019003587100024003775200802004016500033012036500077012366510009013136530017013226530009013396530016013486530013013646550020013777730030013978560006014279030018014330483179  a199902       199811                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aK14  aJ1110aThree Strikes and You're Out: Demographic Analysis of Mandatory Prison Sentencing10aSchmertmann, Carl P.10aAmankwaa, Adansi A.10aLong, Robert D.  aCenter for the Study of Population, FL State U  aAlbany State U  aTetra Tech NUS, Inc  aMuch of the debate about the costs and benefits of "three-strikes" laws for repeat felony offenders is implicitly demographic, relying on unexamined assumptions about prison population dynamics. However, even state-of-the-art analysis has omitted important demographic details. We construct a multistate life-table model of population flows to and from prisons, incorporating age-specific transition rates estimated from administrative data from Florida. We use the multistate life-table model to investigate patterns of prison population growth and aging under many variants of three-strikes laws. Our analysis allows us to quantify these demographic changes and suggests that the aging of prison populations under three-strikes policies will significantly undermine their long-run effectiveness. 4aCriminal Law         b(K14) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Law  a Population  a Prisons  aJournal Article  g35g4h445-63tDemography  iN  aNovember 199801987naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450104001601000022002647000016002861100020003027100009003225200862003316500113011936500069013066500109013756510011014846530018014956530012015136530016015256530010015416530012015516550020015637730030015838560006016139030018016190483180  a199902       199811                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aD31  aO1510aDoes It Matter Who Answers the Race Question?

Using novel data from a 1995 national survey in Brazil, we find that the estimates of racial income inequality based on self-classification are lower than those based on interviewer classification. After human capital and labor market controls, whites earn 26% more than browns with interviewer classification but earn only 17% more than browns with self-classification. Black-brown differences hardly change. Blacks earn 13% and 12% less than browns with interviewer classification and self-classification, respectively. We contend that interviewer classification of race is more appropriate because analysts of racial inequality are interested in the effects of racial discrimination, which depends on how others classify one's race. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBrazil  aHuman Capital  a Income  a Inequality  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g35g4h465-74tDemography  iN  aNovember 199801576naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450112001521000019002641100015002835200794002986500041010926500066011336510009011996530011012086530017012196550020012367730030012568560006012869030018012920483181  a199902       199811                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ71  aJ1610aRevisiting Occupational Sex Segregation in the United States, 1910-1990: Results from a Log-Linear Approach10aWeeden, Kim A.  aStanford U  aI reexamine trends in the strength and structure of occupational sex segregation in the United States from 1910 to 1990. Log-multiplicative models show significant change in the association between gender and occupation. Contrary to conventional characterizations, a substantial proportion of this change occurred before 1970. Likewise, a margin-free index shows more integration over the century than do conventional indices. These discrepancies arise from occupation-specific variations in the trajectory of sex segregation: highly segregated occupations were especially likely to integrate between 1930 and 1940. I identify regions of the occupational structure and pivotal periods in which shifts in segregation occurred and compare these results with conventional historical accounts. 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aGender  a Segregation  aJournal Article  g35g4h475-87tDemography  iN  aNovember 199801727naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450080001681000018002481100016002665200669002826500041009516500070009926500066010626500083011286510009012116530017012206530021012376530012012586530016012706530017012866550020013037730030013238560006013539030018013590483182  a199902       199811                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ71  aC43  aJ16  aJ2410aOccupational Gender Segregation: Index Measurement and Econometric Modeling10aWatts, Martin  aU Newcastle  aEmpirical studies of gender segregation by occupation must be founded on rigorous measurement procedures. There appears to be a consensus that any index used in the analysis of time-series or international cross-section employment data must be either margin-free or decomposable to yield a margin-free component. On the other hand, Charles and Grusky (1995) advocate the use of multiplicative log models from which a margin-free odds ratio can be derived. In this paper, I contrast the construction and interpretation of the index of dissimilarity and the Karmel-MacLachlan index with the multiplicative modeling of gender segregation and the associated log index. 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71) 4aIndex Numbers and Aggregation; Leading indicators         b(C43) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24)  aU.K.  aEconometrics  a Employment Data  a Gender  a Occupation  a Segregation  aJournal Article  g35g4h489-96tDemography  iN  aNovember 199801862naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450065001521000021002177000019002381100015002577100020002725201071002926500041013636500066014046510023014706530016014936550020015097730031015298560006015609030018015660483183  a199902       199811                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ71  aJ1613aThe Past, Present, and Future of Sex Segregation Methodology10aGrusky, David B.10aCharles, Maria  aStanford U  aU CA, San Diego  aWe review the logic underlying margin-free analyses of sex segregation arrays. In the course of our review we show that the Karmel-MacLachlan decomposition does not live up to its margin-free billing, as the index upon which it rests, I[subscript p], is itself margin-sensitive. Moreover, because the implicit individualism of D is necessarily inconsistent with margin-free analysis, the field would do well to abandon not merely the Karmel-MacLachlan decomposition but all related efforts to purge marginal dependencies from D-inspired measures. The criticisms that Watts (1998) levels against our log-multiplicative approach are likewise unconvincing. We demonstrate that our preferred models pass the test of organizational equivalence, that the "problem" of zero cells can be solved by applying well-developed methods for ransacking incomplete or sparse tables, and that simple log-multiplicative models can be readily devised to analyze disaggregate arrays. We illustrate these conclusions by analyzing a new cross-national archive of detailed segregation data. 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aSelected Countries  aSegregation  aJournal Article  g35g4h497-504tDemography  iN  aNovember 199801905naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450086001521000018002381100016002565201194002726500041014666500066015076530016015736550020015897730030016098560006016399030018016450483184  a199902       199811                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ71  aJ1613aThe Analysis of Sex Segregation: When Is Index Measurement Not Index Measurement?10aWatts, Martin  aU Newcastle  aIn their paper in this issue, Grusky and Charles (1998) make a number of dubious claims about the measurement and interpretation of sex segregation. First, they incorrectly claim that only log-odds measures yield margin-free measures of segregation. Second, the estimation and testing of a limited class of log-linear models does not provide an independent test of the appropriateness of a log-odds ratio index to measure segregation. Their estimation informs them of the statistically justifiable degree of occupational disaggregation, not whether a log-odds ratio is superior to, say, a linear index in the measurement of segregation. Finally, their index A is beset with problems of interpretation, not withstanding their arguments, and their additional measures, A[subscript W] and A[subscript B], suffer similar problems, Grusky and Charles are, however, correct in arguing that measurement procedures should be margin-free. Further, I concur with the view that the adoption of a single annual summary measure of segregation cannot be justified, because it is premised on the assumption that individual occupations, or groups of occupations, exhibit similar trends in sex segregation. 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aSegregation  aJournal Article  g35g4h505-08tDemography  iN  aNovember 199802204naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450097001601000029002571100044002865201143003306500038014736500076015116500113015876530011017006530012017116530012017236530013017356530015017486530012017636530017017756550020017927730030018128560006018429030018018480483185  a199902       199811                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aJ1510aComment on 'Compromised Birth Outcomes and Infant Mortality among Racial and Ethnic Groups.'10avan der Veen, Willem Jan  aPopulation Research Centre, U Groningen  aFrisbie, Forbes, and Pullum (1996) show that it is meaningful to account for low birth weight, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth-retardation when analyzing differences in compromised birth outcomes and infant mortality among racial and ethnic groups. I compare their findings for the 1987 U.S. birth cohort with findings for the 1988 U.S. birth cohort, using linked birth and infant death vital statistics from the National Center for Health Statistics. I focus on their calculation of fetal growth curves, which are highly at odds with the curves commonly used in the obstetric and pediatric literature. I compare birth outcome distributions and infant death probabilities using Frisbie et al.'s method and other standards, I conclude that Frisbie et al.'s method is not suited for the study of intrauterine growth-retardation at the population level because of the major flaws in gestational age measurement that exist in the type of data they use. An appropriate alternative is to apply a standard of normal intrauterine growth derived from antenatal estimation of fetal weight-for-gestational-age to the vital statistics data. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aBirths  a Deaths  a Health  a Infants  a Mortality  a Racial  a Retardation  aJournal Article  g35g4h509-17tDemography  iN  aNovember 199800877naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450064001601000023002241100037002476500038002846500076003226500113003986530011005116530015005226550020005377730030005578560006005879030018005930483186  a199902       199811                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aJ1510aBirth Outcome, Not Pregnancy Process: Reply to van der Veen10aFrisbie, W.

An analysis of four data sets (the Current Population Survey, the National Survey of Families and Households, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth) shows significant numbers of cohabitors among recipients of AFDC. An even more surprising finding is the large number of married women on welfare. We also report the results of a telephone survey of state AFDC agencies conducted to determine state rules governing cohabitation and marriage. The survey results indicate that, in a number of respects, AFDC rules encourage cohabitation. Finally, we conduct an analysis of the impact of AFDC rules on cohabitation, marriage, and single motherhood and find weak evidence in support of incentives to cohabit. 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAFDC  a Families  a Marriage  a Mothers  a Single Mother  a Welfare  a Youth  aJournal Article  g35g3h259-78tDemography  iN  aAugust 199800627naa  2200205   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450078001441000019002221100015002416500084002566510009003406550020003497730030003698560006003999030016004050476721  a199811       199808                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aChanges in Assortative Mating: The Impact of Age and Education, 1970-199010aQian, Zhenchao  aAZ State U 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g35g3h279-92tDemography  iN  aAugust 199801442naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450090001441000017002347000017002511100026002687100026002945200637003206500084009576510009010416530017010506530012010676530012010796550020010917730031011118560006011429030016011480476722  a199811       199808                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aFamily and Sociodemographic Influences on Patterns of Leaving Home in Postwar Britain10aMurphy, Mike10aWang, Duolao  aLondon School of Econ  aLondon School of Econ  aWe identify child-level and parent-level characteristics associated with children's patterns of leaving home.

We explored rising occupational stratification by ethnicity in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Analyses of census data from 1982 and 1990 pointed to educational disadvantages faced by ethnic minorities as the most plausible explanation for the change. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant increase in the effect of education on high-status occupational attainment but no change in the effect of ethnicity. Net of education, ethnic differences in high-status occupational attainment were negligible. In contrast, large ethnic differences in manufacturing and agricultural occupations persisted after education and geography were statistically controlled. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71)  aChina  aEducation  a Minorities  aJournal Article  g35g3h323-33tDemography  iN  aAugust 199801793naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450059001681000026002271100015002535200662002686500065009306500109009956500172011046500066012766510013013426530011013556530015013666530014013816550020013957730030014158560006014459030016014510476726  a199811       199808                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ61  aO15  aR23  aJ1610aGender, Migration, and Career Trajectories in Malaysia10aChattopadhyay, Arpita  aKS State U  aWith data from the Malaysian Family Life Survey, I use a continuous-state hazards model to study the impact of migration on the dynamics of individuals' careers.

Male-female differences in the outcome of family migration, however, are visible only in transitions into and out of employment. 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aMalaysia  aGender  a Migration  a Mobility  aJournal Article  g35g3h335-44tDemography  iN  aAugust 199800816naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450036001601000023001961100009002196500038002286500077002666500109003436510012004526530014004646550020004787730030004988560006005289030016005340476727  a199811       199808                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ11  aO1510aMortality in Vietnam, 1979-198910aMerli, M.

First, does the receipt of child support have beneficial effects for children with absent fathers apart from increasing income? Second, do the effects of child support differ when child-support awards and payments are made cooperatively as opposed to being court ordered? Third, are any positive effects of child support solely a product of unmeasured differences among fathers and families? Controlling for the socioeconomic characteristics of the child and family, we find some evidence that receipt of child support has a positive impact on children's cognitive test scores over and above its contribution to total income. However, the effects vary by test, by race, and by reason for father's absence. Our results also indicate that the distinction between cooperative and noncooperative awards is important. Finally, our instrumental variables estimates show that the effects of child support persist after we control for unobserved characteristics of fathers and families. Coauthors are H. Elizabeth Peters, Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, and Judith R.

Our sample includes the fathers of 6,009 children born over a two-year period to 3,855 teenage mothers receiving AFDC in three economically depressed inner cities. These fathers provide little social and economic support to their children. Support declines as their children age from infants to toddlers and as fathers' relationships with the mothers grow more distant. Fathers' employment status and educational attainment positively affect the amount of economic support that they provide but do not strongly influence the amount of social support they provide. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aAFDC  a Children  a Infants  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g35g2h175-86tDemography  iN  aMay 199801902naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450132001521000026002847000023003101100015003337100063003485200883004116500076012946500084013706510009014546530013014636530014014766530015014906530013015056550020015187730031015388560006015699030013015750471821  a199809       199805                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1210aParenting from a Distance: The Effects of Paternal Characteristics on Contact between Nonresidential Fathers and Their Children10aCooksey, Elizabeth C.10aCraig, Patricia H.  aOH State U  aHarvard Institute for International Development, Harvard U  aChanges in marital and fertility behavior have influenced the role of father for many men. We use data from the first two waves of the National Survey of Families and Households to examine various sociodemographic, situational, and attitudinal characteristics that might influence the degree of contact between nonresidential fathers and their minor children. We tap two different dimensions of distance parenting and find that although several variables influence both visiting and talking on the telephone or writing letters, some factors (the presence of multiple children in a household) predict visiting only, while others (child's age and gender) predict only verbal/written contact. Similarly, some of the life course decisions made by fathers appear to crowd out their involvement with nonresidential children, whereas other decisions reinforce their parenting behavior. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Families  a Fertility  a Marital  aJournal Article  g35g2h187-200tDemography  iN  aMay 199801891naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450108001521000028002607000026002887000022003141100037003367100009003737100037003825200815004196500076012346500084013106510009013946530016014036530014014196530014014336530012014476530013014596550020014727730030014928560006015229030013015280471822  a199809       199805                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1210aPaternal Involvement with Adolescents in Intact Families: The Influence of Fathers over the Life Course10aHarris, Kathleen Mullan10aFurstenberg, Frank F.10aMarmer, Jeremy K.  aCarolina Population Center, U NC  aU PA  aCarolina Population Center, U NC  aWe measure the quality and quantity of fathers' involvement with adolescent children in intact families over time using longitudinal data from The National Survey of Children. We examine differentials in fathers' involvement by children's and family characteristics and model the long-term effects of fathers' involvement on children's outcomes in the transition to adulthood. Fathers are more involved with sons than with daughters and they disengage from adolescents with increasing marital conflict. We find beneficial effects for children of father's involvement in three domains: educational and economic attainment, delinquent behavior and psychological well-being. The course of affective relations throughout adolescence also has a beneficial effect on delinquent behavior and psychological well-being. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aAdolescents  a Children  a Families  a Family  a Marital  aJournal Article  g35g2h201-16tDemography  iN  aMay 199801607naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450095001521000018002477000026002657000025002911100049003167100015003657100019003805200623003996500076010226500084010986510015011826530013011976530014012106550020012247730030012448560006012749030013012800471823  a199809       199805                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1210aFathers and Absent Fathers: Sociodemographic Similarities in Britain and the United States10aClarke, Lynda10aCooksey, Elizabeth C.10aVerropoulou, Georgia  aLondon School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine  aOH State U  aCity U, London  aUsing data from the British Household Panel Survey and the National Survey of Families and Households in the United States, we present a sociodemographic profile of fathers and compare the determinants of absent fatherhood in each country. Although fatherhood has a younger profile in the United States, especially for blacks, predictors of fathers ' residency with their children are remarkably similar in the two countries. In both countries, the strongest predictor of a father's absence is the parents' relationship to each other at the time of the child's birth. Policy implications of this finding are discussed. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.K.; U.S.  aChildren  a Families  aJournal Article  g35g2h217-28tDemography  iN  aMay 199801722naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450097001601000023002571100063002805200654003436500076009976500084010736500109011576510010012666530018012766530018012946530015013126530012013276550020013397730030013598560006013899030013013950471824  a199809       199805                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ12  aO1510aMen Matter: Additive and Interactive Gendered Preferences and Reproductive Behavior in Kenya10aDodoo, F. Nii-Amoo  aAfrican Population Policy Research Center and Vanderbilt U  aThe extent of men's roles in reproductive decision-making in Africa is a subject of contention. Despite the volume of work on the roles men play in fertility decisions, there have been few attempts to derive direct empirical estimates of the effect of men's preferences on reproductive behavior. I employ 1989 and 1993 Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys to examine the relative roles of the reproductive preferences of males and females on contraceptive use. Additive and interactive measures of preferences document a significant effect of men's preferences which may eclipse women's preferences. The implications of these findings are discussed. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aKenya  aContraceptive  a Demographics  a Fertility  a Health  aJournal Article  g35g2h229-42tDemography  iN  aMay 199800826naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450075001521000021002277000022002481100021002707100021002916500076003126500084003886510009004726530010004816550020004917730030005118560006005419030013005470471825  a199809       199805                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1210aWork, Income, the Economy, and Married Fathers as Child-Care Providers10aCasper, Lynne M.10aO'Connell, Martin  aUS Census Bureau  aUS Census Bureau 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aChild  aJournal Article  g35g2h243-50tDemography  iN  aMay 199801811naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450141001521000020002931100037003135200845003506500084011956500113012796510009013926530013014016530014014146530012014286530012014406550020014527730030014728560006015029030013015080471826  a199809       199805                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1510aHave African American Men Become Less Committed to Marriage? Explaining the Twentieth Century Racial Cross-Over in Men's Marriage Timing10aKoball, Heather  aCarolina Population Center, U NC  aPrior to World War II, the median age at marriage for white men was later than that for African American men. Since World War II, African American men have, on average, married later than white men. A discrete-time hazard model using data from the National Survey of Families and Households was analyzed to explain this racial cross-over in men's timing of marriage. Dramatic increases in the educational attainment of African American parents and the large movement of African Americans out of the South brought about the racial cross-over in the timing of marriage. Increased enrollment in higher education among African American men also contributed to the racial cross-over in the timing of marriage. Although lack of full-time employment and military service delayed marriage, these factors did not contribute to the racial cross-over. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aFamilies  a Marriage  a Parent  a Racial  aJournal Article  g35g2h251-58tDemography  iN  aMay 199801797naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450089001521000023002411100036002645200878003006500077011786500113012556510009013686530011013776530013013886530018014016530016014196550020014357730028014558560006014839030018014890471807  a199809       199802                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ1510aReconstructing the Size of the African American Population by Age and Sex, 1930-199010aPreston, Samuel H.  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aWe estimate the size of the African American population in five-year age groups at census dates from 1930 to 1990 using a three-part strategy. For cohorts born after 1935, we follow the U.S. Census Bureau in using classical demographic analysis. To estimate the size of cohorts born before 1895, we use extinct-generation estimates. For remaining cohorts, we implement an age/period/cohort model of census counts. All approaches are applied to a data set in which the age distribution of deaths has been corrected for age misreporting. Results provide strong confirmation of the basic validity of Census Bureau estimates of census under-counts for African Americans while extending estimates to new cohorts and periods. Our estimates are less consistent with an historical series prepared by Coale and Rives (1973). Coauthors are Irma T. Elo, Andrew Foster, and Haishan Fu. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Cohorts  a Demographics  a Population  aJournal Article  g35g1h1-21tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199801928naa  2200409   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450096001681000020002647000020002847000019003041100009003237100009003327100036003415200669003776500038010466500076010846500077011606500113012376510009013506530012013596530021013716530015013926530016014076530010014236530012014336550020014457730029014658560006014949030018015000471808  a199809       199802                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aJ11  aJ1513aThe Ecology of Race and Socioeconomic Distress: Infant and Working-Age Mortality in Chicago10aGuest, Avery M.10aAlmgren, Gunnar10aHussey, Jon M.  aU WA  aU WA  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aWe examine the effects of education unemployment and racial segregation on age-, sex-, and race-specific mortality rates in racially defined Chicago community areas from 1989 to 1991. Community socioeconomic factors account for large observed areal variations in infant and working-age mortality but especially working-age mortality for the black population. For black men the mortality consequences of living in economically distressed communities are quite severe. Segregation effects on mortality are more modest and largely operate through neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, although some direct effects of segregation on mortality for blacks are apparent. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aInfants  a Mortality Rates  a Mortality  a Population  a Race  a Racial  aJournal Article  g35g1h23-34tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199801604naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450099001521000019002517000019002707000022002891100014003117100042003257100015003675200672003826500113010546500042011676510009012096530011012186550020012297730029012498560006012789030018012840471809  a199809       199802                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aI2110aChanges in Racial Identification and the Educational Attainment of American Indians, 1970-199010aEschbach, Karl10aSupple, Khalil10aSnipp, C.

We test the hypotheses that this impact was limited to metropolitan areas and to states with small Indian populations. We find that educational attainment for American Indians rose sharply between 1970 and 1990 and that changes in racial identification were an important component of this increase in 1980 but not in 1990. Increases in educational attainment were concentrated in metropolitan areas and occurred in states with large and small Indian populations. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21)  aU.S.  aRacial  aJournal Article  g35g1h35-43tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199800954naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450052001601000021002121100016002336500077002496500064003266500172003906510009005626530016005716530016005876550020006037730029006238560006006529030018006580471810  a199809       199802                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aQ25  aR2310aPopulation Growth and Air Quality in California10aCramer, James C.  aU CA, Davis 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aRenewable Resources and Conservation: Water         b(Q25) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aAir Quality  a Population  aJournal Article  g35g1h45-56tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199802230naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450052001681000019002201100050002395201098002896500076013876500084014636500042015476500109015896510012016986530013017106530018017236530015017416530012017566530012017686530015017806550020017957730029018158560006018449030018018500471811  a199809       199802                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ12  aI21  aO1510aFamily Size and Children's Education in Vietnam10aAnh, Truong Si  aInstitute for Econ Research, Ho Chi Minh City  aData from the nationally representative 1994 Inter-Censal Demographic Survey are used to examine the association between family size and children's schooling in Vietnam. The data provide information on several education measures for all children over age 10, including children no longer residing in the household. Although a clear inverse bivariate association between family size and children's school attendance and educational attainment is evident, multivariate analysis controlling for urban/rural residence, region, parents' education, household wealth, and child's age, reveals that much of this association, especially that predicting educational attainment, is attributable to these other influences. Moreover, much of the effect that remains after statistical adjustment for the other influences is seen mainly at the largest family sizes. We consider the implications of these findings for current population policy in Vietnam and the possible features of the Vietnamese context that might account for the modest association.

The results indicate that turnover in child care is quite high and that child and family characteristics help explain turnover. Important factors include the mother's wage, the cost of child care, age of the child, and previous child-care decisions. The reduced-form nature of the analysis makes it difficult to determine whether these factors are important because they are associated with unstable child-care supply or because they affect family decisions, conditional on supply factors. The results provide no direct evidence that child-care turnover is higher in states with more unstable child-care markets. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aLabor Turnover; Vacancies; Layoffs         b(J63)  aU.S.  aChild  a Mothers  a Turnover  a Youth  aJournal Article  g35g1h83-96tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199801820naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450090001601000024002507000019002741100074002937100009003675200684003766500076010606500084011366500109012206510013013296530013013426530026013556530015013816530012013966550020014087730030014288560006014589030018014640471814  a199809       199802                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ12  aO1510aEconomic and Cultural Influences on the Decision to Leave Home in Peninsular Malaysia10aJohnson, Richard W.10aDaVanzo, Julie  aInstitute for Health, Health Care Policy, & Aging Research, Rutgers U  aRAND  aAlthough the departure of children from the parental home is an important life-cycle event, few studies have investigated nest-leaving in developing countries. Using retrospective data from the Second Malaysian Family Life Survey, we estimate hazard models of nest-leaving in Peninsular Malaysia.

We also find that the median age of departure from home has declined sharply over the past 40 years, a period of rapid social and economic change in Malaysia. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aMalaysia  aChildren  a Developing Countries  a Education  a Family  aJournal Article  g35g1h97-114tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199802018naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450088001601000016002487000019002647000017002831100017003007100017003177100009003345200985003436500084013286500076014126500109014886510010015976530011016076550020016187730030016388560006016689030018016740471815  a199809       199802                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ13  aO1510aIntergenerational Relations in Urban China: Proximity, Contact, and Help to Parents10aBian, Fuqin10aLogan, John R.10aBian, Yanjie  aSUNY, Albany  aSUNY, Albany  aU MN  aAlthough most older Chinese parents live with an adult son or daughter, most adult offspring do not live with parents. We examine the relations of these noncoresident offspring with parents in terms of proximity, frequency of contact, and exchange of help. Based on a 1993 random sample survey conducted in two major Chinese cities, we find that although rates of coresidence are high, noncoresident sons and daughters live close to parents, have frequent contact with their parents, and provide regular help to parents. Relationships with noncoresident sons and daughters are unaffected by whether parents coreside with another child. There is some evidence of closer relationships with sons than with daughters, but parents without a son receive as much help from all children as do parents with sons. The effects of these and other predictors are estimated in multivariate analyses, and results are interpreted in terms of the persistence or change of traditional family norms. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aChina  aParent  aJournal Article  g35g1h115-24tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199801852naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450110001521000023002621100046002855200931003316500084012626500076013466510009014226530013014316530013014446530012014576530019014696550020014887730030015088560006015389030018015440471816  a199809       199802                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aTrends in Single Mothers' Living Arrangements from 1970 to 1995: Correcting the Current Population Survey10aLondon, Rebecca A.  aBerkeley Planning Associates, Oakland, CA  aI examine trends in single mothers' living arrangements using data from the 1970-1995 Current Population Surveys. I create a consistent trend by correcting a coding problem that stemmed from the misidentification of children living in multigenerational house-holds before 1984. Revised estimates show that the number of single mothers in each of these years was undercounted by 200,000-300,000. All of these women were subfamily heads living with their parents, and the problem occurred disproportionately among teens and black women. The uncorrected trend falsely indicates a large increase in the share of single mothers living with their parents. In reality, there was little change in the percentage of single mothers living in this arrangement over the time period. However, the data indicate a large increase in the rate of cohabitation and a comparable decline in the rate of living independently among this population. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Mothers  a Parent  a Single Mother  aJournal Article  g35g1h125-31tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199801418naa  2200217   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450037001441000027001811100031002085200797002396500076010366530014011126550020011267730030011468560006011769030018011820471796  a199809       199711                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aExplaining Fertility Transitions10aMason, Karen Oppenheim  aEast-West Center, Honolulu  aIn this essay, I suggest that the crisis in our understanding of fertility transitions is more apparent than real. Although most existing theories of fertility transition have been partially or wholly discredited, this reflects a tendency to assume that all fertility transitions share one or two causes, to ignore mortality decline as a precondition for fertility decline, to assume that pretransitional fertility is wholly governed by social constraints rather than by individual decision-making, and to test ideas on a decadal time scale. I end the essay by suggesting a perceptual, interactive approach to explaining fertility transitions that is closely allied to existing theories but focuses on conditions that lead couples to switch from postnatal to prenatal controls on family size. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aFertility  aJournal Article  g34g4h443-54tDemography  iN  aNovember 199701752naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450071001601000020002311100009002515200681002606500084009416500166010256500163011916510009013546530012013636530013013756550020013887730030014088560006014389030018014440471797  a199809       199711                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aN31  aN3213aThe Rise of Divorce and Separation in the United States, 1880-199010aRuggles, Steven  aU MN  aI use the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series to assess the potential effects of local labor-market conditions on long-term trends and race differences in marital instability. The rise of female labor-force participation and the increase in nonfarm employment are closely associated with the growth of divorce and separation. Moreover, higher female labor-force participation among black women and lower economic opportunities for black men may account for race differences in marital instability before 1940, and for most of such differences in subsequent years. However, unmeasured intervening cultural factors are probably responsible for at least part of these effects. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32)  aU.S.  aDivorce  a Marital  aJournal Article  g34g4h455-66tDemography  iN  aNovember 199701061naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450085001601000033002451100009002786500084002876500166003716500163005376510009007006530012007096550020007217730030007418560006007719030018007770471798  a199809       199711                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aN31  aN3210aComment on 'The Rise of Divorce and Separation in the United States, 1880-1990.'10aOppenheimer, Valerie Kincade  aUCLA 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32)  aU.S.  aDivorce  aJournal Article  g34g4h467-72tDemography  iN  aNovember 199701068naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450102001601000023002621100009002856500084002946500166003786500163005446510009007076530012007166550020007287730030007488560006007789030018007840471799  a199809       199711                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aN31  aN3210aComment on Steven Ruggles's 'The Rise of Divorce and Separation in the United States, 1880-1990.'10aPreston, Samuel H.  aU PA 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32)  aU.S.  aDivorce  aJournal Article  g34g4h473-74tDemography  iN  aNovember 199701068naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450105001601000020002651100009002856500084002946500166003786500163005446510009007076530012007166550020007287730030007488560006007789030018007840471800  a199809       199711                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aN31  aN3213aThe Rise of Divorce and Separation in the United States, 1880-1990: Reply to Oppenheimer and Preston10aRuggles, Steven  aU MN 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32)  aU.S.  aDivorce  aJournal Article  g34g4h475-79tDemography  iN  aNovember 199702216naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450068001681000021002367000019002577000022002761100012002987100012003107100012003225200943003346500077012776500057013546500109014116500172015206510010016926530011017026530015017136530013017286530015017416550020017567730030017768560006018069030018018120471801  a199809       199711                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ18  aO15  aR2310aMigration, Fertility, and State Policy in Hubei Province, China10aGoldstein, Alice10aWhite, Michael10aGoldstein, Sidney  aBrown U  aBrown U  aBrown U  aDespite China's one-child family planning policy, the nation experienced a slight rise in the birth rate in the mid-1980s. Many observers attributed this rise to the heightened fertility of those rural-to-urban migrants who moved without a change in registration (temporary migrants), presumably to avoid the surveillance of family planning programs at origin and destination. Using a sequential logit analysis with life-history data from a 1988 survey of Hubei Province, we test this possibility by comparing nonmigrants, permanent migrants, and temporary migrants. While changing family planning policies have a strong impact on timing of first birth and on the likelihood of higher-order births, migrants generally do not have more children than nonmigrants. In fact, migration tends to lower the propensity to have a child. More specifically, the fertility of temporary migrants does not differ significantly from that of other women. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aDemographic Economics: Public Policy         b(J18) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aChina  aBirths  a Fertility  a Migrant  a Migration  aJournal Article  g34g4h481-91tDemography  iN  aNovember 199701985naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450084001521000022002367000028002581100009002867100022002955201030003176500076013476500084014236510009015076530011015166530018015276530012015456530016015576530011015736550020015847730031016048560006016359030018016410471802  a199809       199711                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1210aSibling Models of Socioeconomic Effects on the Timing of First Premarital Birth10aPowers, Daniel A.10aHsueh, James Cherng-tay  aU TX  aNational Taiwan U  aData on 1,090 pairs of sisters from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth are used to estimate the effects of observed individual-level factors, common family-level variables, and shared unobserved family-level traits on the timing of premarital births. Results show a moderate correlated risk of premarital childbearing among siblings after controlling for the effects of measured covariates. The effect of older sisters' out-of wedlock childbearing on the timing of younger sisters premarital birth is overestimated when shared unmeasured family-level traits are ignored. Public policy measures designed to reduce premarital births have a smaller multiplier effect via reduced younger sisters' premarital births because unmeasured family-level factors are less amenable to policy measures. However, because the older-sibling effect is large when other sources of variability in premarital birth timing are controlled, interventions may be effective in reducing premarital births among young women in high-risk families. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Childbearing  a Family  a Premarital  a Youth  aJournal Article  g34g4h493-511tDemography  iN  aNovember 199701573naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450138001521000018002907000021003081100037003297100011003665200672003776500076010496500038011256510016011636530018011796530012011976550020012097730030012298560006012599030018012650471803  a199809       199711                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aI1210aEffect of Provider Characteristics on Choice of Contraceptive Provider: A Two-Equation Full-Information Maximum-Likelihood Estimation10aAkin, John S.10aRous, Jeffrey J.  aCarolina Population Center, U NC  aU N TX  aWe use surveys of households and health-care facilities conducted in the same area at the same time to determine which characteristics of providers attract users of contraceptives.

The results suggest that for the Cebu, Philippines region, small local clinics that focus on family planning tend to be most favored by clients. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aPhilippines  aContraceptive  a Health  aJournal Article  g34g4h513-23tDemography  iN  aNovember 199701827naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450103001441000020002477000021002671100017002887100017003055201008003226500172013306510009015026550020015117730030015318560006015619030018015670471804  a199809       199711                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aR2310aResidential Mobility between Cities and Suburbs: Race, Suburbanization, and Back-to-the-City Moves10aSouth, Scott J.10aCrowder, Kyle D.  aSUNY, Albany  aSUNY, Albany  aInformation from the 1979 to 1985 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics is merged with data on respondents' tract and metropolitan area of residence to examine patterns and determinants of residential mobility between central cities and suburbs. Consistent with the life-cycle model of residential mobility, mobility in both directions declines with age, but on balance the presence of young children deters moving to the suburbs. Among blacks, education increases the probability of moving from cities to suburbs, while high income retains blacks and whites in suburbs. Consistent with the place stratification model, blacks are substantially less likely than whites to move from cities to suburbs, and substantially more likely to move from suburbs to cities, even after standardizing for racial differences in sociodemographic characteristics. High levels of violent crime and unemployment in cities relative to suburbs also tend to spur city-to-suburb mobility or inhibit suburb-to-city moves. 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g34g4h525-38tDemography  iN  aNovember 199701634naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450074001521000019002261100050002455200696002956500113009916500172011046510015012766530015012916550020013067730030013268560006013569030018013620471805  a199809       199711                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aR2311aAn Occupational Tale of Two Cities: Minorities in London and New York10aModel, Suzanne  aSocial & Demographic Research Institute, U MA  aIn this paper, queuing theory is tested through an examination of the occupational attainment of six groups of non-whites in London and New York.

Drawing on data from the two waves of the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFU), we examine the effects of economic circumstances of both partners in cohabiting unions on the transition to marriage. Focusing on both partners in a relationship affords a more direct test of the relative importance of men's versus women's economic circumstances. Our findings suggest that only the male partner's economic resources affect the transition to marriage, with positive economic situations accelerating marriage and deterring separation. Our results imply that despite trends toward egalitarian gender-role attitudes and increasing income provision among women, cohabiting men's economic circumstances carry far more weight than women's in marriage formation. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aFamilies  a Marriage  a Spouse  aJournal Article  g34g3h331-41tDemography  iN  aAugust 199701557naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450056001521000023002081100042002315200743002736500076010166500066010926510009011586530011011676530011011786530018011896550020012077730030012278560006012579030016012630471788  a199809       199708                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1610aCouple Childbearing Desires, Intentions, and Births10aThomson, Elizabeth  aCenter for Demography & Ecology, U WI  aUsing new panel data from the National Surveys of Families and Households, I investigate the effects of wives' and husbands' childbearing desires on their spouses' intentions, and the effects of spouses' desires and intentions on subsequent births. The results show clearly that husbands' desires and intentions influence couples' births, with approximately equal force to that of wives' desires and intentions. When couples disagreed about wanting a child, each partners' intentions were shifted toward not having a child; and disagreement in desires or intentions were reflected in birth rates that were lower than average. These patterns were generally not different for couples with more or less traditional gender roles or attitudes. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Child  a Childbearing  aJournal Article  g34g3h343-54tDemography  iN  aAugust 199702092naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450084001601000021002441100044002655201087003096500076013966500084014726500109015566510010016656530017016756530012016926530014017046550020017187730030017388560006017689030016017740471789  a199809       199708                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ12  aO1510aPolygyny and Reproductive Behavior in Sub-Saharan Africa: a Contextual Analysis10aEzeh, Alex Chika  aMacro International, Inc, Calverton, MD  aIn this paper I examine the effect of polygyny on aggregate reproductive behavior. I argue that within countries there exist different polygyny regimes, each exhibiting a unique reproductive pattern. Using the 1988/1989 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHSI) data, I identity three distinct regimes: low-polygyny, mid-polygyny, and high-polygyny regimes. The results of the bivariate and multivariate analyses reveal strong differences in reproductive preferences and behaviors across polygyny regimes. High-polygyny regimes, for instance, maintain a value orientation that favors and encourages high reproductive performance. The force of this pronatalism operates equally for men and women; but whereas men in this regime attain their reproductive goals by marrying multiple wives, women attain theirs by maximizing their reproductive capabilities. This maximization occurs through early initiation of sexual/reproductive activity, universal marriage and minimal interruption of marriage, nonuse of contraception within a union, and a positive attitude toward high fertility. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aKenya  aDemographics  a Health  a Polygyny  aJournal Article  g34g3h355-68tDemography  iN  aAugust 199701575naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450057001521000023002091100050002325200764002826500076010466500038011226510013011606530018011736530019011916530015012106550020012257730030012458560006012759030016012810471790  a199809       199708                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aI1210aLearning in Social Networks and Contraceptive Choice10aKohler, Hans-Peter  aMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research  aA puzzling observation in the diffusion of modern fertility control is the persistent diversity in contraceptive practices across communities or social strata. I propose a model of "learning in social networks " to explain this diversity with the random dynamics of word-of-mouth communication. Women are uncertain about the merits of modern contraception and estimate the different qualities of available methods based on imprecise information from network partners. Their contraceptive choices are determined by this estimate and by private knowledge about one's personal characteristics. This process of social learning leads to path-dependent adoption of fertility control within, and diversity in contraceptive practices across villages or social strata. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aS.

The results suggest that there are significant effects on fertility behavior of community-level family planning services, labor-market conditions and infrastructure development. These results provide insights regarding the structural determinants of contraceptive use and fertility that are useful for drawing policy implications. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aPhilippines  aContraceptive  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g34g3h385-98tDemography  iN  aAugust 199701664naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450126001521000024002781100015003025200749003176500076010666500038011426510009011806530011011896530012012006530013012126530013012256530024012386530015012626550020012777730031012978560006013289030016013340471792  a199809       199708                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aI1210aPremature Birth and the Changing Composition of Newborn Infectious Disease Mortality: Reconsidering 'Exogenous' Mortality10aSowards, Kathryn A.  aWA State U  aLinked death and birth records from San Antonio Texas reveal that infectious infant mortality is increasingly a function of premature birth and low birth weight. Between 1935 and 1944, 4% of infectious infant deaths had associated causes involving prematurity and related conditions; by 1980, 25% of infectious infant deaths involved prematurity and more than 40% of those infants weighed less than 2,500 grams. The shift in birth-weight composition results almost entirely from an increase in very low-weight births. Under conditions of advanced perinatal technology infectious infant mortality should no longer be viewed as wholly exogenous. These findings further undermine the contemporary relevance of the exogenous-endogenous distinction. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Deaths  a Disease  a Infants  a Infectious Disease  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g34g3h399-409tDemography  iN  aAugust 199701192naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450124001601000024002847000021003087000019003291100037003487100059003857100059004446500076005036500038005796500109006176510015007266530011007416530015007526530015007676550020007827730030008028560006008329030016008380471793  a199809       199708                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aI12  aO1510aEstimating Childhood Mortality Trends from Routine Data: A Simulation Using the Preceding Birth Technique in Bangladesh10aBairagi, Radheshyam10aShuaib, Muhammad10aHill, Allan G.  aPopulation Studies Centre, Dhaka  aInstitute for Statistical Research & Training, Dhaka U  aCenter for Population & Development Studies, Harvard U 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBangladesh  aBirths  a Childhood  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g34g3h411-20tDemography  iN  aAugust 199701790naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450051001441000018001957000019002131100020002327100020002525201047002726500077013196510023013966530017014196530016014366550020014527730030014728560006015029030016015080471794  a199809       199708                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1110aPopulation Momentum Expresses Population Aging10aKim, Young J.10aSchoen, Robert  aJohns Hopkins U  aJohns Hopkins U  aPopulation momentum and population aging occur when an initially growing population experiences a reduction in fertility to replacement level. Conceptually and empirically, momentum and aging express the same change, albeit on different scales. Fundamentally, they are two manifestations of the underlying process of demographic transformation. Reconsider three measures of aging over the transition to stationarity: the increase in mean population age, the decrease in the proportion under age 30, and the increase in the proportion over age 65. The three measures of aging are highly correlated, though the relationship to momentum is weakest for the increase in the proportion over age 65. We find that momentum is linearly related to aging. In both model and actual populations, a one-year increase in mean age translates into about 4.5% more population growth. The population below age 30 does not grow over the transition to stationarity, and the ratio of initial to ultimate proportions under age 30 is virtually identical to momentum. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aSelected Countries  aDemographics  a Population  aJournal Article  g34g3h421-27tDemography  iN  aAugust 199701533naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450066001521000018002181100036002365200662002726500172009346500056011066510009011626530011011716530013011826550020011957730030012158560006012459030016012510471795  a199809       199708                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aR23  aI3210aUrban Labor Markets and Individual Transitions Out of Poverty10aIceland, John  aPopulation Studies Center, U MI  aUsing data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the U.S. census, I examine the effect of four structural characteristics on individual poverty exits: (1) economic restructuring, (2) skills mismatches, (3) racial residential segregation, and (4) welfare benefit levels. Results show that these factors play a role in explaining African Americans' economic disadvantages, but they have a weaker and often contrary impact on whites' poverty exits. Overall, the differing impact of the contextual characteristics on African Americans and whites exacerbates social stratification and illustrates racial divisions that continue to pervade the labor market. 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Welfare  aJournal Article  g34g3h429-41tDemography  iN  aAugust 199701629naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450087001521000022002391100009002615200872002706500076011426500057012186510013012756530018012886550020013067730030013268560006013569030013013620423135  a199709       199705                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1810aGeographic Information Systems, Spatial Network Analysis, and Contraceptive Choice10aEntwisle, Barbara  aU NC  aHow does family planning accessibility affect contraceptive choice?

The new measures reveal (1) important travel time effects even when family planning outlets are close by; (2) independent effects of road composition; (3) the relevance of alternative sources of family planning supply; and (4) the importance of the local history of program placement.

Both factors affect the probability of having a second child, but only the acceptance of a one-child certificate has a significant and strong effect on the second-birth interval. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aChina  aBirths  aJournal Article  g34g2h189-97tDemography  iN  aMay 199700789naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450066001521000017002187000023002351100015002587100015002736500077002886500065003656510009004306530014004396550020004537730031004738560006005049030013005100423137  a199709       199705                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ6113aThe Number of Israeli Immigrants in the United States in 199010aCohen, Yinon10aHaberfeld, Yitchak  aTel Aviv U  aTel Aviv U 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  aJournal Article  g34g2h199-212tDemography  iN  aMay 199701019naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450118001601000016002781100053002946500077003476500065004246500172004896510009006616530014006706550020006847730030007048560006007349030013007400423138  a199709       199705                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ61  aR2310aChanging Patterns of Internal Migration 1970-1990: A Comparative Analysis of Jews and Whites in the United States10aRebhun, Uzi  aHarman Institute of Contemporary Jewry, Hebrew U 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aMigration  aJournal Article  g34g2h213-23tDemography  iN  aMay 199701792naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450056001521000016002081100009002245200950002336500172011836500065013556510009014206530014014296530014014436550020014577730030014778560006015079030013015130423139  a199709       199705                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aR23  aJ6113aThe Mobility Experience and Neighborhood Attachment10aBolan, Marc  aU WA  aIn this study, I consider variables associated with an individual's most recent move into his or her current residence as predictors of neighborhood attachment. Using the 1978-1979 Seattle Community Attachment Survey, if ind that elements of the mobility experience such as an individual s past history of migration, the motivations for moving, the amount of time involved in the move, and the distance traveled during the move have an effect on short-and long-term neighborhood attachment patterns independent of residential stability and investment predictors. The findings imply that psychosocial factors such as familiarity with the environment, increased premove exposure to the new environment, and perceived control during instances of transition have some impact on individuals' postmove attitudes and behaviors, and suggest that researchers should look beyond traditional "types of people" explanations of urban neighborhood attachment. 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aMigration  a Mobility  aJournal Article  g34g2h225-37tDemography  iN  aMay 199700856naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450060001521000027002127000020002391100055002597100032003146500065003466500065004116510009004766530014004856530010004996550020005097730030005298560006005599030013005650423140  a199709       199705                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ61  aJ3110aMeasuring Immigrant Wage Growth Using Matched CPS Files10aDuleep, Harriet Orcutt10aRegets, Mark C.  aUrban Institute and Social Security Administration  aNational Science Foundation 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  a Wage  aJournal Article  g34g2h239-49tDemography  iN  aMay 199701862naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450053001521000020002057000024002251100009002497100009002585200929002676500172011966500065013686510009014336530014014426530019014566530016014756550020014917730030015118560006015419030013015470423141  a199709       199705                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aR23  aJ6110aMeasuring Spatial Focusing in a Migration System10aPlane, David A.10aMulligan, Gordon F.  aU AZ  aU AZ  aEquality indexes used in other geographical contexts may be used to gauge the degree of spatial focusing in an entire migration system or within the gross in- and out-migration fields of specific regions. They provide useful indicators of overall shifts in the patterns of interregional migration and can help give insight into the population redistributive roles played by specific regions. Perhaps the most common equality index used to measure income distribution is the Gini coefficient, yet it appears almost never to have been applied in migration research. In this paper we set forth a variety of Gini indexes to be used for different migration analyses and illustrate their application with recent data on U.S. interstate movements. We argue that the Gini index provides some singularly useful insights that differ from those afforded by other measures more commonly found to date in the migration analyst's toolkit. 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aMigration  a Out Migration  a Population  aJournal Article  g34g2h251-62tDemography  iN  aMay 199701620naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450091001521000019002431100015002625200745002776500084010226500113011066510009012196530019012286530014012476530012012616550020012737730030012938560006013239030013013290423142  a199709       199705                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1510aBreaking the Racial Barriers: Variations in Interracial Marriage between 1980 and 199010aQian, Zhenchao  aAZ State U  aUsing PUNKS data from the 1980 and the 1990 U.S. Census. I apply log-linear models to examine interracial marriage among whites, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans. Rarely, but increasingly between 1980 and 1990, interracial marriage of whites occurs most frequently with Asian Americans, followed by Hispanics, and then by African Americans. Interracial marriage tends to be educationally homogamous and the odds of interracial marriage increase with couples' educational attainment. Among interracially married couples with different educational attainments, both men and women from lower status racial groups but with high education levels tend to marry spouses from a higher status racial group with low education levels. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aAsian American  a Marriage  a Racial  aJournal Article  g34g2h263-76tDemography  iN  aMay 199701773naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450110001601000020002707000020002901100016003107100016003265200719003426500084010616500076011456500083012216510011013046530013013156530014013286530012013426530012013546550020013667730030013868560006014169030013014220423143  a199709       199705                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ13  aJ2410aFamily Dissolution, Family Reconstitution, and Children's Educational Careers: Recent Evidence for Sweden10aJonsson, Jan O.10aGahler, Michael  aStockholm U  aStockholm U  aBoth longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses on a large and recent Swedish data set demonstrate that, compared to children in intact families, children who have experienced family dissolution or reconstitution show lower educational attainment at age 16.

Economic deprivation affects children s attainment negatively, but downward social mobility appears to be an even more important causal mechanism: Losing the parent with the higher social position probably reduces social capital and aspirations. When we control for socioeconomic characteristics, a small net effect of separation and reconstitution remains. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24)  aSweden  aChildren  a Families  a Family  a Parent  aJournal Article  g34g2h277-93tDemography  iN  aMay 199701816naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450072001601000023002327000029002557000021002841100015003057100029003207100029003495200742003786500076011206500038011966500073012346510019013076530014013266530014013406530018013546530012013726550020013847730031014048560006014359030013014410423144  a199709       199705                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aI12  aI1810aHousehold Structure and Childhood Immunization in Niger and Nigeria10aGage, Anastasia J.10aSommerfelt, A.

We show that household structure is an important determinant of childhood immunization in Nigeria: Children from nuclear, elementary polygynous, and three-generational households are worse-off than those from laterally extended households. However, the lower odds of full immunization among children from three-generational and elementary polygynous households are attributable to low economic status and low maternal education levels, respectively. In Niger, household structure does not have a significant effect on children's likelihood of being fully immunized. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aHealth: Government Policy; Regulation; Public Health         b(I18)  aNiger; Nigeria  aChildhood  a Children  a Demographics  a Health  aJournal Article  g34g2h295-309tDemography  iN  aMay 199700691naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450024001521000022001767000021001981100014002197100029002336500038002626500077003006550020003777730028003978560006004259030018004310412438  a199706       199702                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1110aEver since Gompertz10aOlshansky, S.

The approach combines the ideas of demography and survival analysis with methods of quantitative genetics and genetic epidemiology. It allows us to analyze the genetic structure of frailty in the Cox-type hazard model with random effects. We demonstrate the implementation of this strategy to survival data on Danish twins. We then evaluate the resulting lower bounds for biological limits of human longevity. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this approach and directions of further research. 4aDemographic Economics: General         b(J10)  aDemography  aJournal Article  g34g1h31-48tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199701579naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450128001601000021002887000019003091100023003287100017003515200541003686500077009096500064009866500056010506510009011066530012011156530012011276530013011396530016011526550020011687730029011888560006012179030018012230412440  a199706       199702                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aH51  aH5511aA Theory of Technophysio Evolution, with Some Implications for Forecasting Population, Health Care Costs, and Pension Costs10aFogel, Robert W.10aCosta, Dora L.  aU Chicago and NBER  aMIT and NBER  aWe argue that over the past 300 years human physiology has been undergoing profound environmentally induced changes made possible by numerous advances in technology. These changes, which we call technophysio evolution, increased body size by over 50 percent and greatly improved the robustness and capacity of vital organ systems. Because technophysio evolution is still ongoing, it is relevant to forecasts of longevity and morbidity and, therefore, to forecasts of the size of the elderly population and pension and health care costs. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aNational Government Expenditures and Health         b(H51) 4aSocial Security and Public Pensions         b(H55)  aU.S.  aElderly  a Health  a Pension  a Population  aJournal Article  g34g1h49-66tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199700962naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450067001601000016002277000025002431100019002687100027002876500038003146500056003526500115004086510009005236530011005326530021005436530011005646550020005757730029005958560006006249030018006300412441  a199706       199702                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aH55  aH2410aDeath and Taxes: Longer Life, Consumption, and Social Security10aLee, Ronald10aTuljapurkar, Shripad  aU CA, Berkeley  aMountain View Research 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aSocial Security and Public Pensions         b(H55) 4aPersonal Income and Other Nonbusiness Taxes and Subsidies; includes inheritance and gift taxes         b(H24)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Social Security  a Taxes  aJournal Article  g34g1h67-81tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199700889naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450109001601000019002691100023002886500052003116500056003636500077004196510009004966530017005056530016005226550020005387730029005588560006005879030018005930412442  a199706       199702                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ26  aH55  aJ1110aRetirement against the Demographic Trend: More Older People Living Longer, Working Less, and Saving Less10aWise, David A.  aHarvard U and NBER 4aRetirement; Retirement Policies         b(J26) 4aSocial Security and Public Pensions         b(H55) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Retirement  aJournal Article  g34g1h83-95tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199700980naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450084001601000021002447000025002651100016002907100016003066500064003226500081003866500077004676510033005446530015005776530012005926550020006047730030006248560006006549030018006600412443  a199706       199702                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aE21  aD91  aJ1113aThe Effects of Economic and Population Growth on National Saving and Inequality10aDeaton, Angus S.10aPaxson, Christina H.  aPrinceton U  aPrinceton U 4aMacroeconomics: Consumption; Saving; Wealth         b(E21) 4aIntertemporal Household Choice; Life Cycle Models and Saving         b(D91) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aThailand; Taiwan; U.K.; U.S.  aPopulation  a Saving  aJournal Article  g34g1h97-114tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199701814naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450068001681000020002367000022002561100009002787100005002875200738002926500059010306500109010896500081011986500108012796530014013876530013014016550020014147730030014348560006014649030018014700412444  a199706       199702                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD12  aO15  aD91  aJ1410aMotives for Intergenerational Transfers: Evidence from Malaysia10aLillard, Lee A.10aWillis, Robert J.  aU MI  a  aIn this paper we discuss a number of hypotheses about motives for intergenerational transfers within the family. We use data on time and money transfers between generations in Malaysia, where there is neither Social Security nor Medicare, to explore these hypotheses empirically. We find evidence supporting the hypotheses that children are an important source of old age security and that old age security is, in part, children's repayment for parental investments in their education. This repayment is partly a function of the children's income and, in the case of females, a function of their spouse's income. We also find evidence supporting the hypotheses that parents and children engage in the exchange of time help for money. 4aConsumer Economics: Empirical Analysis         b(D12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aIntertemporal Household Choice; Life Cycle Models and Saving         b(D91) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aEducation  a Old Age  aJournal Article  g34g1h115-34tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199700893naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450093001521000023002457000019002687000018002871100011003057100011003167100011003276500038003386500077003766510009004536530012004626530016004746530015004906550020005057730030005258560006005559030018005610412445  a199706       199702                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1110aChanges in the Age Dependence of Mortality and Disability: Cohort and Other Determinants10aManton, Kenneth G.10aStallard, Eric10aCorder, Larry  aDuke U  aDuke U  aDuke U 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aCohorts  a Disability  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g34g1h135-57tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199701602naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450061001441000020002057000021002251100009002467100018002555200842002736500108011156510009012236530017012326530013012496550020012627730030012828560006013129030018013180412446  a199706       199702                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1410aDemographic and Economic Correlates of Health in Old Age10aSmith, James P.10aKington, Raynard  aRAND  aUCLA and RAND  aIn this paper we examine disparities in the ability to function among older Americans. We place special emphasis on two goals: (1) understanding the quantitatively large socioeconomic status-health gradient, and (2) the persistence in health outcomes over long periods. We find that there exist strong contemporaneous and long-run feedbacks from health to economic status. In light of these feedbacks, it is important to distinguish among alternative sources of income and the recipient of income in the household. This research also demonstrates that health outcomes at old age are influenced by health attributes of past, concurrent, and future generations of relatives. Finally, we find that the demographic and economic differences that exist among them explain functional health disparities by race and ethnicity, but not be gender. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Old Age  aJournal Article  g34g1h159-70tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199701740naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450088001601000023002481100009002715200762002806500056010426500081010986500069011796510023012486530011012716530016012826530010012986530013013086530018013216550020013397730031013598560006013909030018013960402587  a199703       199611                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI32  aR12  aD3113aThe Age of Extremes: Concentrated Affluence and Poverty in the Twenty-First Century10aMassey, Douglas S.  aU PA  aUrbanization, rising income inequality, and increasing class segregation have produced a geographic concentration of affluence and poverty throughout the world, creating a radical change in the geographic basis of human society. As the density of poverty rises in the environment of the world's poor, so will their exposure to crime, disease, violence, and family disruption. Meanwhile, the spatial concentration of affluence will enhance the benefits and privileges of the rich. In the 21st century the advantages and disadvantages of one's class position will be compounded and reinforced through ecological mechanisms made possible by the geographic concentration of affluence and poverty, creating a deeply divided and increasingly violent social world. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aSize and Spatial Distributions of Regional Economic Activity         b(R12) 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31)  aSelected Countries  aIncome  a Inequality  a Poor  a Spatial  a Urbanization  aJournal Article  g33g4h395-412tDemography  iN  aNovember 199600850naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450102001601000022002621100009002846500056002936500081003496500069004306510023004996550020005227730030005428560006005729030018005780402588  a199703       199611                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI32  aR12  aD3110aComment on 'The Age of Extremes: Concentrated Affluence and Poverty in the Twenty-First Century.'10aDanziger, Sheldon  aU MI 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aSize and Spatial Distributions of Regional Economic Activity         b(R12) 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31)  aSelected Countries  aJournal Article  g33g4h413-16tDemography  iN  aNovember 199600798naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450051001601000021002111100009002326500056002416500081002976500069003786510023004476550020004707730030004908560006005209030018005260402589  a199703       199611                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI32  aR12  aD3113aThe Age of Extremes: A Revisionist Perspective10aFarley, Reynolds  aU MI 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32) 4aSize and Spatial Distributions of Regional Economic Activity         b(R12) 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31)  aSelected Countries  aJournal Article  g33g4h417-20tDemography  iN  aNovember 199601517naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450066001601000018002267000018002447000014002621100019002767100009002957100019003045200550003236500056008736500081009296500069010106510023010796530015011026550020011177730030011378560006011679030018011730402590  a199703       199611                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI32  aR12  aD3113aThe Political Economy of Inequality in the 'Age of Extremes.'10aHout, Michael10aArum, Richard10aVoss, Kim  aU CA, Berkeley  aU AZ  aU CA, Berkeley  aMassey's presidential address correctly points to growing economic inequality as one of the pressing issues of our day, but his analysis gives short shrift to the political institutions that underlie the economic trends.

Using pooled origin-destination data from surveys conducted in Puerto Rico and in the New York metropolitan area, we find that first- and second-generation migrants to the U.S. mainland face substantially higher risks of conceiving and bearing a first child before marriage than do nonmigrants in Puerto Rico. This pattern is due largely to the relatively early transition to sexual activity among mainland women. Given the negative long-term consequences of premarital childbearing for women and their children, our findings call into question the assumption that migrants necessarily experience only positive outcomes as a result of the assimilation process. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.; Puerto Rico  aChild  a Childbearing  a Migrant  a Migration  a Women  aJournal Article  g33g4h429-42tDemography  iN  aNovember 199600868naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450082001521000019002341100017002536500113002706500172003836510009005556550020005647730030005848560006006149030018006200402593  a199703       199611                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aR2310aMaking a Place in the Metropolis: Locational Attainment in Cities and Suburbs10aLogan, John R.  aSUNY, Albany 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g33g4h443-53tDemography  iN  aNovember 199600919naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450078001601000026002387000012002641100009002767100009002856500071002946500065003656500066004306510009004966530024005056530014005296550020005437730030005638560006005939030018005990402594  a199703       199611                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ44  aJ61  aJ1610aGeographic Mobility of Scientists: Sex Differences and Family Constraints10aShauman, Kimberlee A.10aXie, Yu  aU MI  aU MI 4aProfessional Labor Markets; Occupational Licensing         b(J44) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aGeographic Mobility  a Mobility  aJournal Article  g33g4h455-68tDemography  iN  aNovember 199602107naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450083001601000023002437000020002667000024002861100009003107100025003197100009003445201001003536500038013546500076013926500113014686510009015816530011015906530018016016530013016196530015016326530012016476550020016597730030016798560006017099030018017150402595  a199703       199611                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aJ1510aCompromised Birth Outcomes and Infant Mortality among Racial and Ethnic Groups10aFrisbie, W.

Although clinical studies allow more precise classification, the small number of cases tends to result in unreliable estimates of rates and in loss of generalizability. The fetal growth ratio, a measure recently shown to be a valid proxy for maturity, is used here to develop a classification system based on combinations of weight, gestational age, and maturity, which we apply in a comparative analysis of a large data set. The results show large differences in the distribution of compromised births across racial and ethnic groups, as well as significant race/ethnic differentials in the risk of infant mortality associated with adverse outcomes. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Demographics  a Infants  a Mortality  a Racial  aJournal Article  g33g4h469-81tDemography  iN  aNovember 199601711naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450037001521000022001891100015002115200865002266500076010916500084011676510009012516530018012606530011012786530018012896530015013076530013013226550020013357730030013558560006013859030018013910402596  a199703       199611                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1210aTrends in Child Support Outcomes10aHanson, Thomas L.  aSyracuse U  aThis paper examines trends in child support award rates, award amounts, and receipts. We investigate four hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the downward trend in these outcomes during the 1980s: (1) changes in the demographic composition of the population eligible for child support, (2) increases in mothers' income, (3) decreases in fathers' income, and (4) inflation. Our results indicate that trends in nonmarital fertility can explain much of the decline in award rates. The steady downward trend in fathers' incomes during the 1980s also explains a considerable portion of the decline in award rates, award amounts, and receipts. Our results are also consistent with the notion that persistent money illusion is responsible for the decline in real child support awards. Coauthors are Irwin Garfinkel, Sara S. McLanahan, and Cynthia K.

Levels of earnings are uniformly lower for male workers turning 21 between 1980 and 1991 than in 1970-1979, although rates of earnings growth are roughly comparable. Among males turning 21 before 1980, six in 10 (60 percent) of all men and seven in 10 (71 percent) college-educated men attained earnings level by age 30 that were at least twice the poverty level. Corresponding fractions for workers turning 21 between 1980 and 1991 were considerably lower (42 percent and 56 percent). Recent cohorts from all demographic subgroups appeared to have more difficulty than older cohorts in attaining middle-class earnings. 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aMobility  aJournal Article  g33g4h497-509tDemography  iN  aNovember 199600874naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450107001521000019002597000018002787000030002961100009003267100009003357100017003446500065003616500066004266510009004926530009005016550020005107730030005308560006005609030018005660402598  a199703       199611                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ31  aJ1613aThe Effect of the Sex Composition of Jobs on Starting Wages in an Organization: Findings from the NLSY10aEngland, Paula10aReid, Lori L.10aKilbourne, Barbara Stanek  aU AZ  aU AZ  aVanderbilt U 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aWage  aJournal Article  g33g4h511-21tDemography  iN  aNovember 199601531naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450043001521000017001957000022002121100041002347100021002755200646002966500077009426500059010196510009010786530011010876530014010986530015011126530016011276550020011437730030011638560006011939030018011990402599  a199703       199611                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aC5310aOn the Utility of Population Forecasts10aTayman, Jeff10aSwanson, David A.  aSan Diego Association of Governments  aPortland State U  aMany customers demand population forecasts, particularly for small areas. Although the forecast evaluation literature is extensive, it is dominated by a focus on accuracy. We go beyond accuracy by examining the concept of forecast utility in an evaluation of a sample of 2,709 counties and census tracts. We find that forecasters provide "value-added" knowledge for areas experiencing rapid changes or areas with relatively large populations. For other areas, reduced value is more common than added value. Our results suggest that new forecasting strategies and methods such as composite modeling may substantially improve forecast utility. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aForecasting Models; Simulation Methods         b(C53)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Forecast  a Forecasts  a Population  aJournal Article  g33g4h523-28tDemography  iN  aNovember 199601034naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450115001601000020002757000020002957000022003151100013003377100013003507100013003636500038003766500076004146500109004906510014005996530014006136530014006276550020006417730025006618560006006869030016006920397339  a199612       199608                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aO1510aErratum: 'Prenatal and Delivery Care and Childhood Immunization in Guatemala: Do Family and Community Matter?'10aPebley, Anne R.10aGoldman, Noreen10aRodriguez, German  aUnlisted  aUnlisted  aUnlisted 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aGuatemala  aChildhood  a Prenatal  aJournal Article  g33g3hitDemography  iN  aAugust 199601399naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450076001521000024002287000022002527000017002741100009002917100009003007100009003095200509003186500076008276500042009036510009009456530017009546530015009716530015009866550020010017730030010218560006010519030016010570397340  a199612       199608                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aI2110aEducation and the Changing Age Pattern of American Fertility: 1963-198910aRindfuss, Ronald R.10aMorgan, S.

This shift is consistent with arguments we develop about the increased opportunity for women to pursue careers and about changes in the availability of child care. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21)  aU.S.  aChildbearing  a Education  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g33g3h277-90tDemography  iN  aAugust 199601547naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450050001441000018001947000022002121100009002347100013002435200832002566500076010886510018011646530011011826530015011936550020012087730031012288560006012599030016012650397341  a199612       199608                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1313aThe Effects of Temperature on Human Fertility10aLam, David A.10aMiron, Jeffrey A.  aU MI  aBoston U  aMonthly birth and temperature data for a variety of states and countries are used to estimate the effect of short-run temperature fluctuations on fertility. Regressions of monthly births on a flexible specification of lagged monthly temperature show that temperature has quantitatively important effects on both seasonal and nonseasonal variation in births. Summer temperature extremes reduce conceptions in the southern United States, explaining a substantial part of the observed seasonal birth pattern. Extreme cold shows no evidence of affecting conceptions. The results also show significant seasonality in births even after accounting for temperature. Controls for monthly temperature do not explain the persistent spring peak in births in northern Europe. This finding suggests that other factors play an important role. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aSelected MDCs  aBirths  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g33g3h291-305tDemography  iN  aAugust 199601585naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450055001521000022002071100020002295200740002496500076009896500172010656510009012376530013012466550020012597730030012798560006013099030016013150397342  a199612       199608                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aR2313aThe Impact of State-Level Restrictions on Abortion10aMeier, Kenneth J.  aU WI, Milwaukee  aThis research examines 23 different laws passed by state governments in an effort to restrict the number of abortions. It assesses both laws passed and laws actually enforced after the Supreme Court permitted states to restrict access to abortion in 1989. None of the policy actions by state governments has had a significant impact on the incidence of abortion from 1982 to 1992. Abortion rates continue to reflect past abortion rates, the number of abortion providers, whether the state funds abortions for Medicaid-eligible women, urbanism, and racial composition of the population. Recent restrictive policies have not affected these trends. Coauthors are Donald P. Haider-Markel, Anthony J. Stanislawski, and Deborah R.

A.  aRAND  a  aPrior literature has shown that married men live longer than unmarried men. Possible explanations are that marriage protects its incumbents or that healthier men select themselves into marriage. Protective effects, however, introduce the possibility of adverse selection. Those in poor health have an incentive to marry. In this paper we explore the role of health in explaining mortality and marriage patterns, and distinguish protective effects from two types of selection effects. We find adverse selection on the basis of health (unhealthy men tend to (re)marry sooner) and positive selection on the basis of unmeasured factors that both promote good health and encourage marriage. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aHealth  a Marital  a Marriage  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g33g3h313-27tDemography  iN  aAugust 199600709naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450071001521000017002231100020002406500038002606500076002986510010003746530011003846550020003957730030004158560006004459030016004510397344  a199612       199608                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1310aEstimating the Completeness of Under-5 Death Registration in Egypt10aBecker, Stan  aJohns Hopkins U 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aEgypt  aDeaths  aJournal Article  g33g3h329-39tDemography  iN  aAugust 199601608naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450074001441000020002181100009002385201000002476500038012476510009012856530012012946550020013067730030013268560006013569030016013620397345  a199612       199608                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1210aCohort Size and Age-Specific Suicide Rates: A Contingent Relationship10aPampel, Fred C.  aU CO  aTrends in age-specific suicide rates relate to debates about the consequences of population aging and changes in cohort size for social well-being. Easterlin argues that large cohort size increases suicide rates by reducing relative income; Preston claims that suicide rates fall in large cohorts with high levels of political and social power. To integrate these competing arguments, this paper uses aggregate data on 18 high-income nations from 1953 to 1986 to demonstrate that the direction and strength of the relationship be- en cohort size and suicide depend on (1) age of the cohort, (2) gender, (3) national context, and (4) time period. The results show that large cohort size raises suicide for the young and middle-aged, but reduces it for the elderly. Also, the effects of cohort size prove stronger for men than for women, for nations with less collectivist institutions than for nations with more collectivist institutions, and for the 1950s and 1960s than for the 1970s and 1980s. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aMDCs  aSuicide  aJournal Article  g33g3h341-55tDemography  iN  aAugust 199600721naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450079001521000024002311100012002556500065002676500044003326510017003766530014003936550020004077730030004278560006004579030016004630397346  a199612       199608                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ61  aF2210aEconomic Opportunity in Mexico and Return Migration from the United States10aLindstrom, David P.  aBrown U 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aInternational Migration         b(F22)  aMexico; U.S.  aMigration  aJournal Article  g33g3h357-74tDemography  iN  aAugust 199601334naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450043001441000015001877000022002021100025002247100012002495200551002616500172008126510010009846530014009946550020010087730030010288560006010589030016010640397347  a199612       199608                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aR2310aInternal Migration in China, 1950-198810aLiang, Zai10aWhite, Michael J.  aQueens College, CUNY  aBrown U  aThis paper examines the long-term patterns of migration within China between 1950 and 1988. The analysis uses data from China's 1988 2/1,000 Fertility and Birth Control Survey, which asks respondents about their most recent interprovincial move. The results suggest that long-term migration patterns can be explained by political and economic changes in China. We argue that the approaches we introduce can offer significant insight into long-term migration patterns for countries where historical data on migration are unavailable or unreliable. 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aChina  aMigration  aJournal Article  g33g3h375-84tDemography  iN  aAugust 199601484naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450055001521000020002077000021002271100015002487100009002635200688002726500077009606500076010376510009011136530012011226550020011347730030011548560006011849030016011900397348  a199612       199608                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ1310aReconsidering the Increase in Father-Only Families10aGarasky, Steven10aMeyer, Daniel R.  aIA State U  aU WI  aPreviously reported estimates of rapid growth rates among father-only families did not account for cohabitation. An explicit treatment of cohabitation removes about half of the presumed growth. Nevertheless, we find that the number of father-only families grew at more than double the rate of mother-only families during the 1980s. Decomposition analyses show that the largest factor associated with the increase is that fathers now head a greater proportion of all formerly married single-parent families with children. Although the share of single-parent families headed by fathers is larger in 1990 than in 1980 even after controlling for cohabitation, it is smaller than in 1970. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aMothers  aJournal Article  g33g3h385-93tDemography  iN  aAugust 199600891naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450118001521000022002707000022002927000026003141100009003407100009003497100009003586500076003676500066004436510009005096530014005186550020005327730030005528560006005829030013005880389581  a199609       199605                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1611aA Decomposition of Trends in the Nonmarital Fertility Ratios of Blacks and Whites in the United States, 1960-199210aSmith, Herbert L.10aMorgan, S.

This situation has fueled the search for alternative means of delivery. Comparing the performance of alternatives is straightforward if the output measure is a count of commodities distributed, but comparing actual fertility impacts is another matter. I use data from the 1991 Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey to assess the extent of difference among the eventual fertility outcomes of users supplied with similar commodities through varying sources. When the "modern" methods of pill, IUD, and injection are grouped together, the fertility of users supplied with these commodities differs markedly according to their source of supply. I find little evidence for self-selecting of users into supply channels. This result implied that fertility differentials by source are likely due to characteristics of the distribution channels. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aIndonesia  aContraceptive  a Demographics  a Distribution  a Fertility  a Health  aJournal Article  g33g2h153-65tDemography  iN  aMay 199601526naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450094001601000020002547000021002741100009002957100009003045200540003136500038008536500076008916500109009676510016010766530011010926530013011036530015011166550020011317730030011518560006011819030013011870389583  a199609       199605                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aO1510aLongitudinal Analysis of the Effects of Infant-Feeding Practices on Postpartum Amenorrhea10aZohoori, Namvar10aPopkin, Barry M.  aU NC  aU NC  aThe Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey is used to examine the effect of various components of infant feeding patterns on return of menses postpartum.

The results suggest that few unmarried nonblack women with less than a high school degree, expansions of income eligibility lowered the probability of abortion by two to five percentage points. Most of the impact of the Medicaid expansions on abortion occurred in the first round of expansions from approximately 45 percent of the federal poverty level to 100 percent. For black unmarried women with less than a high school degree, we generally find no effect of expansions in Medicaid income eligibility on abortion. 4aWelfare, Well-Being, and Poverty: Government Programs; Provision and Effects of Welfare Programs         b(I38) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aAbortion  a Medicaid  aJournal Article  g33g2h181-92tDemography  iN  aMay 199600837naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450074001601000023002341100009002576500038002666500108003046500066004126510009004786530014004876550020005017730031005218560006005529030013005580389585  a199609       199605                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ14  aJ1611aAfrican-American Mortality at Older Ages: Results of a Matching Study10aPreston, Samuel H.  aU PA 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aMortality  aJournal Article  g33g2h193-209tDemography  iN  aMay 199601596naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450097001601000020002575200740002776500038010176500076010556500109011316510011012406530010012516550020012617730030012818560006013119030013013170389586  a199609       199605                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aO1510aCommunity Characteristics, Individual and Household Attributes, and Child Survival in Brazil10aSastry, Narayan  aThis paper presents an analysis of the relationship between community characteristics, household attributes, and child survival in Brazil. The principal objectives are to investigate how the social and environmental context in which a child is raised affects his or her survival chances and to analyze how household variables modify the effects of community characteristics. The interaction effects we examine help to explain the effects of community characteristics on child survival chances by illuminating the most likely pathways through which these covariates operate. This information is also useful for predicting who is most likely to benefit from public policies to improve community infrastructure, education and health care. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aBrazil  aChild  aJournal Article  g33g2h211-29tDemography  iN  aMay 199601664naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450104001601000020002647000020002847000022003041100009003267100016003357100016003515200574003676500038009416500076009796500109010556510014011646530014011786530012011926530015012046530014012196550020012337730030012538560006012839030013012890389587  a199609       199605                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aO1510aPrenatal and Delivery Care and Childhood Immunization in Guatemala: Do Family and Community Matter?10aPebley, Anne R.10aGoldman, Noreen10aRodriguez, German  aRAND  aPrinceton U  aPrinceton U  aIn this paper we investigate family choices about pregnancy-related care and the use of childhood immunization.

Most migrants' earnings are spent on consumption; few funds are channeled into productive investment. We argue that this view is misleading because it ignores the conditions under which productive investment is likely to be possible and profitable. We analyze the determinants of migrants' savings and remittance decisions, using variables defined at the individual, household, community and macroeconomic levels. We identify the conditions under which U.S. earnings are repatriated to Mexico as remittances and savings and indicate the factors leading to their productive investment.

The quantitative analysis demonstrates the importance of village location and placement of family planning services for patterns of contraceptive choice. The qualitative data provide a complementary perspective, emphasizing the importance of social as well as physical space and giving particular attention to the structure of conversational networks.

Competing-risks hazards models have been developed to model such situations. This paper describes the extension of the discrete-time competing-risks hazards model to a multilevel framework that allows for data at different levels of aggregation. The model is illustrated with data from the 1988 Chinese National Survey of Fertility and Contraceptive Prevalence, which collected complete contraceptive histories. Women may stop using a method of contraception for a number of reasons; this paper describes how one can control for correlations between the outcomes of repeated spells of contraceptive use. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aChina  aContraceptive  a Demography  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g33g1h12-23tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199601306naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450091001441000020002351100043002555200562002986500076008606530018009366530019009546530018009736550020009917730029010118560006010409030018010460381898  a199606       199602                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1313aThe Impact of Postpartum Redundant Use of Contraception on Contraceptive Failure Rates10aCurtis, Sian L.  aMacro International Inc, Calverton, MD  aRedundant use of contraception occurs when periods of contraceptive use overlap with periods of reduced fecundity, and will downwardly bias estimates of contraceptive failure rates. This paper investigates this bias using calendar data from the Demographic and Health Surveys. The paper presents unadjusted and adjusted 12-month failure rates for each of nine countries. The impact of redundant use on failure rates is generally modest. It tends to be greater in Indonesia, however, where both the incidence and the duration of overlap are relatively large. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aContraception  a Contraceptive  a Demographics  aJournal Article  g33g1h24-34tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199600732naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450103001441000021002477000021002681100009002897100009002986500113003076510009004206550020004297730029004498560006004789030018004840381899  a199606       199602                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1510aLatino, Asian, and Black Segregation in U.S. Metropolitan Areas: Are Multiethnic Metros Different?10aFrey, William H.10aFarley, Reynolds  aU MI  aU MI 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g33g1h35-50tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199601758naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450076001521000018002287000019002461100018002657100018002835200852003016500047011536500077012006510009012776530011012866530013012976530015013106530017013256530017013426550020013597730029013798560006014089030018014140381900  a199606       199602                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aR31  aJ1110aImmigration Cohorts and Residential Overcrowding in Southern California10aMyers, Dowell10aLee, Seong Woo  aU Southern CA  aU Southern CA  aTo what degree do immigrants reduce their high rates of residential overcrowding with increasing length of residence in the United States? This question is addressed through the application of a "double cohort" method that nests birth cohorts within immigration cohorts. This method enables duration of immigration effects to be separated from aging effects as cohorts pass through life course phases, when family sizes may be growing or shrinking. The analysis finds that cohort trends differ sharply from the cross-sectional pattern observed at a single point in time. Cohorts' growth in income is found to contribute substantially to the decline in overcrowding over time. Cohort trends among Hispanic immigrants, however, diverge from those among others, indicating much less decrease in overcrowding and even increases over certain age spans. 4aHousing Supply and Markets         b(R31) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Cohorts  a Immigrant  a Immigration  a Residential  aJournal Article  g33g1h51-65tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199601831naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450099001521000022002517000021002731100015002947100009003095200845003186500076011636500084012396510009013236530013013326530013013456530012013586530025013706530013013956530012014086550020014207730029014408560006014699030018014750381901  a199606       199602                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1213aThe Influence of Parents' Marital Dissolutions on Children's Attitudes toward Family Formation10aAxinn, William G.10aThornton, Arland  aPA State U  aU MI  aWe investigate the influence of parents' marital dissolutions on their children's attitudes toward several dimensions of family formation. Hypotheses focus on the role of parents' attitudes as a mechanism linking parents' behavior to their children's attitudes. We test these hypotheses using intergenerational panel data that include measures of parents' attitudes taken directly from parents and measures of children's attitudes taken directly from children. Results demonstrate strong effects of parental divorce, remarriage, and widowhood on children's attitudes toward premarital sex, cohabitation, marriage, childbearing, and divorce. The results also show that parents' own attitudes link their behavior to their children's attitudes, although substantial effects of parental behavior remain after controlling for parents' attitudes. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Divorce  a Family  a Marital Dissolution  a Marital  a Parent  aJournal Article  g33g1h66-81tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199601665naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450067001441000027002117000025002381100009002637100014002725200931002866500076012176510009012936530010013026530014013126550020013267730029013468560006013759030018013810381902  a199606       199602                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aEconomic Incentives for Financial and Residential Independence10aWhittington, Leslie A.10aPeters, H. Elizabeth  aU MD  aCornell U  aIn this paper we examine the impact of the resources of children and of their parents on the children's transition to residential and financial independence. Previous studies of this transition focused primarily on the impact of family structure and parent-child relationships on the decision to leave home, but much less is known about the role of economic factors in the transition to independence. using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) for the period 1968-88, we estimate discrete-hazard models of the probability of achieving residential and financial independence. We find that the child's wage opportunities and the parents' income are important determinants of establishing independence. The effect of parental income changes with the child's age. We also find some evidence that federal tax policy influences the decision to become independent, although the magnitude of this effect is quite small. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  aJournal Article  g33g1h82-97tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199601591naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450076001521000022002281100030002505200764002806500038010446500076010826510015011586530010011736530015011836530014011986530015012126550020012277730030012478560006012779030018012830381903  a199606       199602                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1310aEstimating Seasonality Effects on Child Mortality in Matlab, Bangladesh10aMuhuri, Pradip K.  aWorld Health Organization  aThis paper estimates the net effect of seasonality on child mortality in Matlab. Results suggest that childhood mortality was well above the average monthly level in the hot, dry month of April and in November, the first harvest month of the aman crop. It was found to be remarkably low in the postharvest months of February and March, and also in August. During the hungry months of September and October, children were at a considerably increased risk of mortality, particularly from diarrheal diseases, if mothers had no schooling, but this was not the case if mothers had schooling. The protective effect of the Matlab interventions on childhood death from diarrheal diseases was also greater during the hungry months than during other months of the year. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aBangladesh  aChild  a Childhood  a Children  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g33g1h98-110tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199601643naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450088001521000023002407000022002637000015002851100009003007100009003097100009003185200689003276500113010166500083011296510017012126530014012296530012012436550020012557730030012758560006013059030018013110381904  a199606       199602                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aJ2410aRacial Differences in Occupational Status and Income in South Africa, 1980 and 199110aTreiman, Donald J.10aMcKeever, Matthew10aFodor, Eva  aUCLA  aUCLA  aUCLA  aUsing data on employed men from the 1980 and 1991 South African Censuses, we analyze the determinants of occupational status and income. Whites are found to have much higher occupational status, and especially income, than members of other racial groups. Most of the racial differentials in occupational status can be explained by racial differences in the personal assets that determine occupational attainment (especially education), but only a much smaller fraction of the White/non-White income differential can be so explained. Despite a modest reduction between 1980 and 1991 in the role of race in socioeconomic attainment, the overall picture shows more stability than change. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aHuman Capital; Skills; Occupational Choice; Labor Productivity         b(J24)  aSouth Africa  aEducation  a Racial  aJournal Article  g33g1h111-32tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199600741naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450047001441000022001917000034002137000024002471100009002717100022002807100022003026500076003246530013004006550020004137730030004338560006004639030018004690381905  a199606       199602                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1311aA Theory of the Value of Children: Comment10aLehrer, Evelyn L.20aGrossbard-Shechtman, Shoshana10aLeasure, J.

Our results underscore the importance of economic factors on the transition to marriage for both black and white cohabitors. We also find that for black cohabitors, but not for whites, socio-economic disadvantage during childhood reduces the odds of marriage. The presence of children in cohabiting unions tends to increase the chances of marrying a cohabiting partner for both blacks and whites. Our results demonstrate the importance of including cohabitation in research on the marriage process. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aFamilies  a Marriage  a Race  aJournal Article  g32g4h509-20tDemography  iN  aNovember 199501434naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450053001441000014001977000024002111100015002357100022002505200698002726500084009706510011010546530013010656530016010786550020010947730030011148560006011449030018011500381889  a199606       199511                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aDissolution of Premarital Cohabitation in Canada10aWu, Zheng10aBalakrishnan, T.

In this study we examine two competing outcomes of cohabitation relationships: union separation and legalization of the union through marriage. Our results show that the hazard rate of union dissolution is affected particularly by gender, fertility status, partner's marital status, religion, age at start of cohabitation, year cohabitation commences, and region. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aCanada  aMarriage  a Premarital  aJournal Article  g32g4h521-32tDemography  iN  aNovember 199501515naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450047001521000022001991100009002215200687002306500084009176500109010016510013011106530011011236530015011346530014011496550020011637730030011838560006012139030018012190381890  a199606       199511                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aO1511aA Marriage Trichotomy and Its Applications10aSpeizer, Ilene S.  aU NC  aThis paper promotes research methods specific to men, the new focus of fertility and family planning studies (especially in Sub-Saharan Africa). I propose a novel marriage categorization based on married men's intentions to take another wife. The three marriage groups are currently monogamous men who intend to remain so, currently monogamous men who intend to become polygynous, and currently polygynous men. The first analysis demonstrates that typical marriage analyses may misclassify men who intend to become polygynous. Applications of the marriage trichotomy illustrate that men with varying marital intentions have differing desires regarding fertility and family planning. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aCameroon  aFamily  a Fertility  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g32g4h533-42tDemography  iN  aNovember 199501790naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450108001521000021002607000023002811100011003047100054003155200681003696500077010506500109011276510023012366530011012596530017012706530012012876530018012996530021013176530012013386530016013506550020013667730030013868560006014169030018014220381891  a199606       199511                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aO4711aAggregate Population and Economic Growth Correlations: The Role of the Components of Demographic Change10aKelley, Allen C.10aSchmidt, Robert M.  aDuke U  aE Claiborne Robins School of Business, U Richmond  aThe results of recent correlations showing a negative impact of population growth on economic development in cross-country data for the 1980s, versus "nonsignificant" correlations widely found for the 1960s and 1970s, are examined with contemporaneous and lagged components of demographic change, convergence-type economic modeling, and several statistical frameworks. The separate impacts of births and deaths are found to be notable but offsetting in the earlier periods. In contrast, the short-run costs (benefits) of births (mortality reduction) increase (decrease) significantly in the 1980s, and the favorable labor-force impacts of past births are not fully offsetting. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aMeasurement of Economic Growth; Aggregate Productivity; Cross-Country Output Convergence         b(O47)  aSelected Countries  aBirths  a Convergence  a Deaths  a Demographics  a Economic Growth  a Growth  a Population  aJournal Article  g32g4h543-55tDemography  iN  aNovember 199501530naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450079001521000020002311100020002515200792002716500076010636500066011396510009012056550020012147730030012348560006012649030018012700381892  a199606       199511                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1610aTrade-Offs in the Family: Sibling Effects on Daughters' Activities in 191010aSassler, Sharon  aJohns Hopkins U  aThis paper uses the 1910 Census Public Use Sample to examine how the presence and activities of key family members shaped the labor force activity, domestic work, and schooling of working-age daughters. There is no evidence that daughters worked to send their brothers to school; parents practiced a more egalitarian distribution of resources than the literature suggests. Having brothers and sisters in school increased a daughter's odds of attending school herself. Similarly, daughters with employed siblings were more likely to be gainfully employed. Nonetheless, parents allocated activities to sons and daughters in ways that reinforced traditional gender roles. Working brothers increase daughters' likelihood of working in the home, while reducing their odds of attending school. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g32g4h557-75tDemography  iN  aNovember 199501621naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450105001441000024002491100009002735200963002826500053012456510009012986530010013076550020013177730030013378560006013679030018013730381893  a199606       199511                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ2210aJob, Family, and Gender: Determinants of Nonstandard Work Schedules among Employed Americans in 199110aPresser, Harriet B.  aU MD  aThis study provides the most recent national estimates of the prevalence of employment during nonstandard hours (evenings, nights, or rotating hours) and on weekends. It also examines in a multivariate context the relevance of job and family characteristics as determinants of such employment, separately for men and for women. The findings support the contention that the demand for employment during nonstandard hours and weekends is pervasive throughout the occupational hierarchy, but particularly in service occupations and in personal service industries and for both men and women. Gender differences exist, however, in the relevance of family factors. Being married reduces women's but not men's likelihood of employment during nonstandard hours and the presence of children affects women's but not men's hours and days of employment. (The direction of the effect for women depends on the children's age.) Implications of these findings are discussed. 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22)  aU.S.  aWomen  aJournal Article  g32g4h577-98tDemography  iN  aNovember 199501714naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450068001601000021002281100015002495200681002646500113009456500065010586500102011236510009012256530018012346530013012526530015012656530017012806530016012976550020013137730031013338560006013649030018013700381894  a199606       199511                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aJ61  aR2110aImmigrant Characteristics and Hispanic-Anglo Housing Inequality10aKrivo, Lauren J.  aOH State U  aThis paper seeks to explain why Hispanic households in the United States live in housing markedly inferior to Anglos'. I argue that immigrant characteristics of Hispanic households and the metropolitan areas in which Hispanics live play important roles in determining such inequality in the housing market. Empirical analyses of homeownership, household crowding and housing costs demonstrate that immigration plays a role in explaining relatively low homeownership and high household crowding for each of four large Hispanic populations (Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and other Hispanics). The role of immigrant characteristics in determining housing costs is much weaker. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand         b(R21)  aU.S.  aHomeownership  a Housing  a Immigrant  a Immigration  a Inequality  aJournal Article  g32g4h599-615tDemography  iN  aNovember 199501823naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450090001601000023002507000018002737000019002911100027003107100015003377100009003525200754003616500113011156500065012286500041012936510009013346530019013436530020013626530017013826550020013997730030014198560006014499030018014550381895  a199606       199511                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aJ61  aJ7110aUnintended Consequences of Immigration Reform: Discrimination and Hispanic Employment10aLowell, B.

The General Accounting Office (GAO) reported widespread IRCA-related discrimination but did not link reported discriminatory practices to discriminatory employment behavior. We analyze the GAO's random survey and, controlling for selectivity effects, demonstrate that employers who report discriminatory practices actually employ fewer Hispanics. Although the measured reduction of Hispanic employment due to IRCA is fairly small, this finding parallels research alerting us to adverse consequences of a law that so far has achieved few of its intended efforts. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71)  aU.S.  aDiscrimination  a Discriminatory  a Immigration  aJournal Article  g32g4h617-28tDemography  iN  aNovember 199500964naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450106001601000023002667000024002891100013003137100013003266500077003396500076004166500066004926510009005586530012005676530012005796550020005917730027006118560006006389030018006440381886  a199606       199511                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ13  aJ1610aErrata [Cohort Trends in the Lifetime Distribution of Female Family Headship in the U.S., 1968-1985].10aMoffitt, Robert A.10aRendall, Michael S.  aUnlisted  aUnlisted 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aCohorts  a Female  aJournal Article  g32g4hiiitDemography  iN  aNovember 199501970naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450078001521000023002307000025002537000031002781100020003097100046003297100063003755200796004386500084012346500076013186510009013946530010014036530015014136530014014286530018014426530013014606530012014736530014014856530012014996550020015117730031015318560006015629030016015680381875  a199606       199508                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aParental Divorce in Childhood and Demographic Outcomes in Young Adulthood10aCherlin, Andrew J.10aKiernan, Kathleen E.20aChase-Lansdale, P.

Our analyses control for predisruption characteristics of the child and the family, including emotional problems, cognitive achievement and socio-economic status. The results show that by age 23, those whose parents divorced were more likely to leave home because of friction, to cohabit, and to have a child outside marriage than were those whose parents did not divorce. Young adults whose parents divorced, however, were no more or less likely to marry or to have a child in a marriage. Moreover, even in the divorced group, the great majority did not leave home because of friction or have a child outside marriage. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.K.  aChild  a Childhood  a Children  a Demographics  a Divorce  a Family  a Marriage  a Parent  aJournal Article  g32g3h299-318tDemography  iN  aAugust 199501731naa  2200373   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450071001601000026002317000021002577000020002781100009002987100009003077100015003165200677003316500084010086500043010926500076011356510009012116530010012206530015012306530014012456530013012596530013012726550020012857730030013058560006013359030016013410381876  a199606       199508                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aD64  aJ1313aThe Effect of Divorce on Intergenerational Transfers: New Evidence10aFurstenberg, Frank F.10aHoffman, Saul D.10aShrestha, Laura  aU PA  aU DE  aWorld Bank  aThis paper draws on new data on intergenerational transfers of time and money that were collected in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We use these data to examine the effects of divorce on these transfers. We find that the timing of divorce is critical. Fathers and mothers involved in late divorces have similar levels of transfers with their adult children, while divorce during a child's childhood years increases transfers with mothers and sharply lowers them with fathers. Somewhat surprisingly, we find no evidence that divorced fathers who paid child support are more likely to be involved in intergenerational transfers than those who did not pay child support. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aAltruism; Philanthropy         b(D64) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Childhood  a Children  a Divorce  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g32g3h319-33tDemography  iN  aAugust 199500801naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450097001521000023002491100009002726500108002816500077003896510009004666530012004756550020004877730030005078560006005379030016005430381877  a199606       199508                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ14  aJ1113aThe Elderly Who Live Alone in the United States: Historical Perspectives on Household Change10aKramarow, Ellen A.  aU MI 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aElderly  aJournal Article  g32g3h335-52tDemography  iN  aAugust 199501755naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450062001601000019002227000022002411100017002637100005002805200799002856500043010846500076011276500108012036510009013116530013013206530011013336530013013446550020013577730030013778560006014079030016014130381878  a199606       199508                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD64  aJ13  aJ1410aSelf-Interest and Altruism in Intergenerational Relations10aLogan, John R.10aSpitze, Glenna D.  aSUNY, Albany  a  aSelf-interest and altruism in the relationships between generations can be manifested both within the family and in the public arena. The present study compares levels of support between age groups 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and 80plus on a series of attitudes about "appropriate" parent-child relations and governmental programs for older people. On both kinds of measures, older people tend consistently to be least likely to adopt the "pro-elderly" position. This association is maintained when controls are introduced in multivariate analyses. Altruism, not self-interest, seems to govern the attitudes of the older generation in this sample. This finding should mitigate potential conflicts over issues of intergenerational equity and fairness, both within the family and in public policy. 4aAltruism; Philanthropy         b(D64) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aAltruism  a Child  a Elderly  aJournal Article  g32g3h353-64tDemography  iN  aAugust 199501623naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450064001601000022002247000024002461100009002707100005002795200638002846500066009226500053009886500076010416510009011176530013011266530018011396530013011576530018011706530013011886550020012017730030012218560006012519030016012570381879  a199606       199508                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aJ22  aJ1310aExplaining Changes in Married Mothers' Employment over Time10aLeibowitz, Arleen10aKlerman, Jacob Alex  aRAND  a  aEmployment of married mothers with preschool children rose dramatically between 1971 and 1990. Using CPS data, we find that about one-fifth of the increase in labor supply can be attributed to changes in mothers' demographic characteristics (age, education and number of children). Changes in the earnings opportunities of new mothers and their husbands explain another one-fifth of the growth in employment. Over the two decades, infants up to three months old became less of a barrier to employment, while women's labor supply became more sensitive to their own earnings opportunities and less sensitive to those of their husbands. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Demographics  a Infants  a Labor Supply  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g32g3h365-78tDemography  iN  aAugust 199501622naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450107001521000020002597000019002791100021002987100026003195200672003456500069010176500077010866510009011636530017011726530018011896530012012076530016012196550020012357730031012558560006012869030016012920381880  a199606       199508                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aD31  aJ1110aDemographic Change, Rising Earnings Inequality, and the Distribution of Personal Well-Being, 1959-198910aKaroly, Lynn A.10aBurtless, Gary  aRAND Corporation  aBrookings Institution  aThis paper uses new methods to determine the sources of the sharp fall and then the steep rise in personal income inequality between 1959 and 1989. The increase in the proportion of single-head families tended to boost inequality over the entire period. Forty percent of the reduction in income inequality in the 1960s occurred because of the decline in earnings inequality among male head of families; more than one-third of the increase in inequality after 1969 occurred because inequality in male earnings soared. Since 1979 females' gains in earnings have increased inequality because these gains have been concentrated increasingly in families with high incomes. 4aPersonal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions         b(D31) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Distribution  a Income  a Inequality  aJournal Article  g32g3h379-405tDemography  iN  aAugust 199501453naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450105001521000023002577000024002801100012003047100014003165200611003306500066009416500076010076510009010836530011010926550020011037730030011238560006011539030016011590381881  a199606       199508                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aJ1310aCohort Trends in the Lifetime Distribution of Female Family Headship in the United States, 1968-198510aMoffitt, Robert A.10aRendall, Michael S.  aBrown U  aCornell U  aWe use the PSID Relationship File to estimate cohort trends in the lifetime incidence and duration of female family headship.

The mean number of years spent in headship between ages 14 and 59 rose dramatically over the period. The increase arose from an increased number of hardship spells, including an increase in the number of women ever experiencing headship, but not at all from an increase in durations of headship spells; those decreased slightly. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aFemale  aJournal Article  g32g3h407-24tDemography  iN  aAugust 199500890naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450101001521000022002537000020002757000020002951100009003157100009003247100009003336500084003426500076004266510009005026530017005116550020005287730030005488560006005789030016005840381882  a199606       199508                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1313aThe Changing Character of Stepfamilies: Implications of Cohabitation and Nonmarital Childbearing10aBumpass, Larry L.10aRaley, R.

This paper uses newly developed econometric methods to explicitly address the endogeneity of cohabitation before marriage in the hazard of marital disruption by allowing the unobserved heterogeneity components to be correlated across the decisions to cohabit and to end a marriage. These methods are applied to data from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. We find significant heterogeneity in both cohabitation and marriage disruption and discover evidence of self-selection into cohabitation. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aMarital Dissolution  a Marital  a Marriage  a Premarital  aJournal Article  g32g3h437-57tDemography  iN  aAugust 199501538naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450051001521000023002037000021002261100060002477100015003075200690003226500070010126500084010826510009011666530013011756550020011887730030012088560006012389030016012440381884  a199606       199508                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aC43  aJ1211aA Case Study on the Use of Multiple Imputation10aFreedman, Vicki A.10aWolf, Douglas A.  aAgency for Health Care Policy & Research, Rockville, MD  aSyracuse U  aMultiple imputation is a relatively new technique for dealing with missing values on items from survey data. Rather than deleting observations for which a value is missing, or assigning a single value to incomplete observations, one replaces each missing item with two or more values. Inferences then can be made with the complete data set. This paper presents an application of multiple imputation using the 1987-1988 National Survey of Families and Households. We impute several binary indicators of whether the respondent's elderly mother/mother-in-law is married. Descriptive statistics are then presented for the sample of adult children with an unmarried mother or mother-in-law. 4aIndex Numbers and Aggregation; Leading indicators         b(C43) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aFamilies  aJournal Article  g32g3h459-70tDemography  iN  aAugust 199501153naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450058001441000029002021100012002315200524002436500051007676530017008186530016008356550020008517730030008718560006009019030016009070381885  a199606       199508                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1010aInterpolating Demography with Families and Households10aGoldscheider, Frances K.  aBrown U  aThis paper argues that the field of household and family demography serves a critical role in the development of our understanding of the determinants and consequences of population trends.

The decline of marital fertility in Iran provides a quasi-experimental setting for addressing this question. Massive economic growth started in 1955; measurable ideational changes took place in 1967. We argue that the decline is described more precisely by demand theory than by ideation theory. It began around 1959, just after the onset of massive economic growth but well before the ideational changes. It paralleled the rapid growth of participation in primary education, and we found no evidence that the 1967 events had any effect on the decline. More than one-quarter of the decline can be attributed to the reduction in child mortality, a key mechanism of demand theory. Several other findings support this main conclusion. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aIran  aFertility  aJournal Article  g32g2h159-82tDemography  iN  aMay 199501521naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450077001441000025002217000023002461100009002697100009002785200747002876500113010346510009011476530017011566530012011736550020011857730031012058560006012369030013012420361106  a199510       199505                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1510aDemographic Foundations of Political Empowerment in Multiminority Cities10aClark, William A.

We examine two potential models of local empowerment: "dominance," whereby each group is the majority of voters in single election districts (reinforcing separative tendencies), and "influence," whereby a group gains "influential minority" status in several districts (reinforcing unifying tendencies). 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Racial  aJournal Article  g32g2h183-201tDemography  iN  aMay 199501243naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450088001441000023002327000019002551100036002747100042003105200447003526500065007996510017008646530012008816530015008936550020009087730030009288560006009589030013009640361107  a199510       199505                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ6110aNew Estimates of Undocumented Mexican Migration and the Probability of Apprehension10aMassey, Douglas S.10aSinger, Audrey  aPopulation Studies Center, U PA  aPopulation Research Center, U Chicago  aUsing a new source of data, we estimate the probability of apprehension among Mexican migrants attempting to cross into the United States without documents.

The analysis focuses on the role of income and financial assistance from relatives and public programs. Using data from the NLS Youth Panel, I construct a causal model of birthweight containing exogenous social and demographic risk factors and intervening proximate determinants of birthweight. A substantial part of the gap in birthweight between white Anglos and other ethnic groups (especially blacks) can be explained by the unfavorable socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the latter. On the other hand, blacks and other minorities smoke less and have other favorable proximate characteristics that depress differences in birthweight. When these proximate determinants are controlled, large ethic differences in birthweight remain unexplained by income and other sociodemographic factors. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Youth  aJournal Article  g32g2h231-47tDemography  iN  aMay 199501508naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450114001521000024002667000022002907000020003121100009003327100009003417100014003505200569003646500052009336500076009856510009010616530018010706530011010886530014010996550020011137730030011338560006011639030013011690361110  a199510       199505                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI11  aJ1310aChanges in the Relationship between Child Support Payments and Educational Attainment of Offspring, 1979-198810aHernandez, Pedro M.10aBeller, Andrea H.10aGraham, John W.  aU IL  aU IL  aRutgers U  aWe examine changes over the 1980s in the effect of child support payments on the educational attainment of children 16 to 19 in the United States, and why child support has a stronger impact than other sources of income.

Compared with adult children raised in intact families, adult children whose parents divorced have less frequent contact with their parents and report a lower-quality relationship with their parents. We observe these negative effects for both custodial and noncustodial parents, although the effects are larger for noncustodial parents. Remarriage of the custodial parent tends to offset the negative impacts of divorce on relations with noncustodial parents. Further, the longer the adult child lived apart from the parent, the weaker are relations with noncustodial parents. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Childhood  a Children  aJournal Article  g32g2h261-80tDemography  iN  aMay 199501387naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450099001441000022002431100060002655200678003256500066010036510009010696530010010786550020010887730030011088560006011389030013011440361112  a199510       199505                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1610aSharing a Home: The Experiences of American Women and Their Parents over the Twentieth Century10aWeinick, Robin M.  aAgency for Health Care Policy & Research, Rockville, MD  aTrends and determinants of daughter-parent coresidence over the twentieth century are examined by using the 1987-88 National Survey of Families and Households. Young women from more recent birth cohorts leave their parents' homes for the first time at earlier ages, but are more likely to make return trips home than those born earlier. Thus cohorts show remarkable consistency in the proportion of life lived in the parental home. For the 1900-1929 birth cohorts, daughters' lifetime probability that a parent will move in with them is approximately 15 percent; younger cohorts show similar age-specific probabilities to date. Explanations for these trends are considered. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aWomen  aJournal Article  g32g2h281-97tDemography  iN  aMay 199500857naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450098001601000025002581100030002836500038003136500064003516500059004156530028004746530017005026550020005197730028005398560006005679030018005730353887  a199508       199502                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aK42  aC5310aEstimates of Early Twentieth-Century U.S. Homicide Rates: An Econometric Forecasting Approach10aEckberg, Douglas Lee  aWinthrop U, Rock Hill, SC 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aIllegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law         b(K42) 4aForecasting Models; Simulation Methods         b(C53)  aEconometric Forecasting  a Forecasting  aJournal Article  g32g1h1-16tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199500891naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450127001521000025002791100039003046500077003436500108004206510009005286530014005376530013005516550020005647730029005848560006006139030018006190353888  a199508       199502                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ1410aEchoes of the Baby Boom and Bust: Recent and Prospective Changes in Living Alone among Elderly Widows in the United States10aMacunovich, Diane J.  aWilliams College, Williamstown, MA 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aBaby Boom  a Elderly  aJournal Article  g32g1h17-28tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199501707naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450085001521000024002371100045002615200818003066500077011246500108012016510009013096530010013186530013013286530015013416550020013567730029013768560006014059030018014110353889  a199508       199502                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ1410aStability and Change in Temporal Distance between the Elderly and Their Children10aSilverstein, Merril  aAndrus Gerontology Center, U Southern CA  aDrawing on a developmental model of late-life migration, this paper investigates how older people's health and social characteristics influence stability and change in their temporal distance from their children. Data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging are used to examine both discrete transitions and continuous change in distance over a four-year period. Decline in older parents' physical health increased the propensity of parents and children to become temporally closer to each other. Among those parent- child pairs who had become closer, the conjunction of declining health and widowhood increased both the degree of non-coresident proximity and the likelihood of transition to coresidence. The findings portray a geographically resilient family that adjusts to the changing needs of its older members. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aAging  a Elderly  a Migration  aJournal Article  g32g1h29-45tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199501757naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450081001521000021002337000020002547000023002741100011002977100015003087100016003235200831003396500084011706500076012546510009013306530017013396530014013566550020013707730029013908560006014199030018014250353890  a199508       199502                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1313aThe Influence of Nonmarital Childbearing on the Formation of First Marriages10aBennett, Neil G.10aBloom, David E.10aMiller, Cynthia K.  aYale U  aColumbia U  aPrinceton U  aWe document a negative association between nonmarital childbearing and the subsequent likelihood of first marriage in the United States, controlling for a variety of potentially confounding influences. Nonmarital childbearing does not appear to be driven by low expectations of future marriage. Rather, it tends to be an unexpected and unwanted event, whose effects on a woman's subsequent likelihood of first marriage and who receive welfare have a particularly low probability of marrying subsequently, although there is no evidence that AFDC recipients have lower expectations of marriage. In addition, we find no evidence that stigma associated with nonmarital childbearing plays an important role in this process or that the demands of children significantly reduce unmarried mothers' time for marriage market activities. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildbearing  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g32g1h47-62tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199501457naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450065001521000021002171100027002385200679002656500053009446500076009976510009010736530017010826530019010996550020011187730029011388560006011679030018011730353891  a199508       199502                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ22  aJ1313aThe Impact of 'Parent Care' on Female Labor Supply Decisions10aEttner, Susan L.  aHarvard Medical School  aData from the 1986-1988 Survey of Income and Program Participation panels were used to analyze how informal caregiving of disabled elderly parents affected female labor supply. Instrumental variables analyses suggested that coresidence with a disabled parent leads to a large, significant reduction in work hours, due primarily to withdrawal from the labor force. Although the impact of nonhousehold member caregiving was insignificant, evidence of an effect was stronger when commitment of caregiving time was greater. Projections of female labor force participation rates should account for potential increases in caregiving demand due to the aging of the U.S. population. 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aLabor Supply  a Participation  aJournal Article  g32g1h63-80tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199501534naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450031001441000023001757000022001981100042002207100042002625200804003046500076011086510009011846530014011936550020012077730029012278560006012569030018012620353892  a199508       199502                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aMeasuring Fertility Demand10aThomson, Elizabeth10aBrandreth, Yvonne  aCenter for Demography & Ecology, U WI  aCenter for Demography & Ecology, U WI  aWe propose a multidimensional conceptualization of fertility demand and evaluate potential measures of each dimension, using data from a telephone survey of Wisconsin residents age 18-34. Most of the measures met tests for interval-level measurement; all produced high estimates of test-retest reliability. We found support for only two dimensions of demand, intensity and certainty; potential measures of centrality had relatively low associations with any of the latent dimensions. Demand certainty improved prediction of fertility expectations beyond a trichotomous (yes, no, don't know) measure, but demand intensity did not. We found mixed evidence for the conceptualization of fertility demand as a single continuum on which desire to avoid pregnancy is the opposite of desire to have a child. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aFertility  aJournal Article  g32g1h81-96tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199501541naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450080001441000022002247000020002461100042002667100037003085200744003456500076010896510009011656530014011746530013011886550020012017730030012218560006012519030018012570353893  a199508       199502                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aRedefining Single-Parent Families: Cohabitation and Changing Family Reality10aBumpass, Larry L.10aRaley, R. Kelly  aCenter for Demography & Ecology, U WI  aCarolina Population Center, U NC  aThis paper explores the implications, for the measured prevalence and duration of mother-only families, of marked changes in nonmarital fertility, unmarried cohabitation, and homeleaving and re-entry. Throughout, estimates are compared on the basis of marital definitions and definitions including cohabitation. The duration of the first single-parent spell appears to have increased under the marital definition, but declines substantially when cohabitations are taken into account. A substantial proportion of single mothers have spent some time as single parents while in their parents' household. Hence we argue that definitions of single-parent families must be based on living arrangements rather than on the parents' marital status. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aFertility  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g32g1h97-109tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199500911naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450145001441000023002897000022003127000020003341100037003547100037003917100037004286500076004656510012005416530018005536550020005717730030005918560006006219030018006270353894  a199508       199502                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aBinary Outcomes and Endogenous Explanatory Variables: Tests and Solutions with an Application to the Demand for Contraceptive Use in Tunisia10aBollen, Kenneth A.10aGuilkey, David K.10aMroz, Thomas A.  aCarolina Population Center, U NC  aCarolina Population Center, U NC  aCarolina Population Center, U NC 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aTunisia  aContraceptive  aJournal Article  g32g1h111-31tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199501873naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450080001521000022002327000023002541100052002777100016003295200949003456500042012946500084013366510009014206530013014296530012014426530012014546530019014666550020014857730030015058560006015359030018015410353880  a199508       199411                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ1210aFamily Structure, Residential Mobility, and School Dropout: A Research Note10aAstone, Nan Marie10aMcLanahan, Sara S.  aJohns Hopkins School of Hygiene & Public Health  aPrinceton U  aThis paper examines the hypothesis that high levels of residential mobility among nonintact families account for part of the well-known association between living in a nonintact family and dropping out of high school. Children from single-parent families and stepfamilies are more likely than children from two-parent families to move during the school year. As much as 30% of the difference in the risk of dropping out between children from stepfamilies and children from intact families can be explained by differences in residential mobility. Previously, mechanisms explaining school failure on the part of children in nonintact families were more plausible for children in single-parent families than for children in stepfamilies; high levels of residential mobility apply to both groups of children. In addition, residential mobility lends itself to manipulation by public policy, with potentially remedial effects for vulnerable children. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aFamilies  a Family  a Parent  a Single Parent  aJournal Article  g31g4h575-84tDemography  iN  aNovember 199401615naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450113001521000017002651100019002825200653003016500109009546500172010636510013012356530012012486530015012606550020012757730030012958560006013259030018013310353881  a199508       199411                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aO15  aR2311aA Sensitivity Analysis of Repeat Migration Attrition in the Study of Migrant Adjustment: The Case of Bangkok10aYang, Xiushi  aOld Dominion U  aStudies of migrant adjustment often conclude that results apply only to remaining migrants. This paper examines the potential bias in using the difference between remaining migrants and natives as a measure of migrant adjustment. The results document that differences between remaining migrants and natives contain bias caused by attrition due to repeat migration. Such bias is small, however, and is unlikely to change migrant-native comparisons. Unless one is concerned with details of differences between migrants and natives, it is unnecessary to be concerned about migration attrition bias in drawing conclusions from the observed differences. 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aThailand  aMigrant  a Migration  aJournal Article  g31g4h585-92tDemography  iN  aNovember 199401764naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450103001601000022002637000024002851100044003097100009003535200646003626500076010086500113010846500068011976510009012656530011012746530017012856530015013026530011013176530011013286550020013397730031013598560006013909030018013960353882  a199508       199411                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ15  aJ2110aEmployment and the Use of Birth Control by Sexually Active Single Hispanic, Black, and White Women10aKraft, Joan Marie10aCoverdill, James E.  aInstitute for Behavioral Research, U GA  aU GA  aPrevious studies of the use of birth control by sexually active single women tend to emphasize family background and aspirations, and restrict their attention to teenagers. We elaborate this framework by considering how labor market experiences might shape the birth control practices of women in their late teens and twenties. Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Force Experiences--Youth Cohort provide evidence that employment histories and wages influence birth control practices, net of the effects of family background, aspirations, and educational attainment. Several pronounced racial and ethnic differences are found. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aLabor Force and Employment, Size, and Structure         b(J21)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Labor Force  a Teenagers  a Women  a Youth  aJournal Article  g31g4h593-602tDemography  iN  aNovember 199401651naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450087001441000023002311100051002545200826003056500076011316510009012076530016012166530018012326530019012506530015012696530015012846550020012997730030013198560006013499030018013550353883  a199508       199411                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aNeighborhood Context and the Transition to Sexual Activity among Young Black Women10aBrewster, Karin L.  aCenter for the Study of Population, FL State U  aPrevious studies report that neighborhood characteristics influence pregnancy and childbearing risk among African-American adolescent women. These studies, however, leave unidentified the effect of many neighborhood properties on the proximate determinants of nonmarital fertility. In this study I examine the effects of neighborhood characteristics on the risk of nonmarital first intercourse and on contraceptive use among black female adolescents. The results suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic status, female employment and marital dissolution rates, and peers' departure from mainstream lifecourse trajectories influence young black women's sexual and contraceptive behavior. The effects of female employment and socioeconomic status are greater for teens in urban neighborhoods than for teens living elsewhere. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAdolescents  a Childbearing  a Contraceptive  a Fertility  a Pregnancy  aJournal Article  g31g4h603-14tDemography  iN  aNovember 199401210naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450088001601000023002487000023002711100059002947100059003536500076004126500163004886500172006516510009008236530014008326550020008467730030008668560006008969030018009020353884  a199508       199411                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aN32  aR2313aThe Persistence of High Fertility in the American South on the Eve of the Baby Boom10aTolnay, Stewart E.10aGlynn, Patricia J.  aCenter for Social & Demographic Analysis, SUNY, Albany  aCenter for Social & Demographic Analysis, SUNY, Albany 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: 1913-         b(N32) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aFertility  aJournal Article  g31g4h615-31tDemography  iN  aNovember 199401513naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450100001441000024002441100046002685200795003146500038011096510024011476530011011716530015011826550020011977730030012178560006012479030018012530353885  a199508       199411                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1211aAge Patterns of Mortality and Cause-of-Death Structures in Sweden, Japan, and the United States10aHimes, Christine L.  aPopulation Research Institute, PA State U  aThis paper uses a new standard model of adult mortality to compare the mortality patterns of Swedes, Japanese, and U.S. whites between 1950 and 1985. It examines changes in the age patterns of mortality and the cause-of-death structures within the populations, and the relationships between those two factors. As Japan has reached a level of mortality similar to that in Sweden, the age patterns of mortality in the two populations have become more similar despite distinct differences in causes of death. The United States has a cause-of-death structure similar to that of Sweden, but the age pattern of mortality is very different. High mortality in the middle age range in the United States results in approximately a one-year loss of life expectancy at age 45 in comparison with Sweden. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.; Japan; Sweden  aDeaths  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g31g4h633-50tDemography  iN  aNovember 199400926naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450060001601000019002201100046002396500076002856500066003616500109004276510013005366530010005496530015005596550020005747730030005948560006006249030018006300353886  a199508       199411                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ16  aO1513aThe Impact of Child Care on Fertility in Urban Thailand10aRichter, Kerry  aPopulation Research Institute, PA State U 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration         b(O15)  aThailand  aChild  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g31g4h651-62tDemography  iN  aNovember 199401328naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450038001441000020001827000021002027000022002231100009002457100009002547100014002635200596002776500076008736530013009496530015009626550020009777730031009978560006010289030016010340344278  a199503       199408                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1311aA Theory of the Value of Children10aFriedman, Debra10aHechter, Michael10aKanazawa, Satoshi  aU WA  aU AZ  aCornell U  aThis paper uses a non-standard value assumption-uncertainty reduction-to explain parenthood.

Next we generate a range of hypotheses that follow both from this assumption and from a subsidiary assumption of marital solidarity enhancement. Finally, we explore the extent to which implications based on these new ideas are supported by the relevant empirical literature. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aChildren  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g31g3h375-401tDemography  iN  aAugust 199401590naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450054001441000019001981100046002175200883002636500076011466510028012226530011012506530015012616550020012767730030012968560006013269030016013320344279  a199503       199408                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1311aA Multistate Model of Fecundability and Sterility10aWood, James W.  aPopulation Research Institute, PA State U  aThis paper develops a multistate hazards model for estimating fecundability and sterility from data on waiting times to conception. Important features of the model include separate sterile and nonsterile states, a distinction between preexisting sterility and sterility that begins after initiation of exposure, and log-normally distributed fecundability among nonsterile couples. Application of the model to data on first birth intervals from Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and the Amish shows that heterogeneity in fecundability is statistically significant at most ages, but that preexisting sterility and new sterility are unimportant before age 40. These results suggest that sterility may not be an important determinant of natural fertility until later reproductive ages. Coauthors are Darryl J. Holman, Anatoli I. Yashin, Raymond J.

These results suggest that if a racial crossover in death occurs, the age pattern of mortality among African-Americans must be far outside the range observed in populations with more accurate data. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g31g3h427-58tDemography  iN  aAugust 199401569naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450045001441000021001897000021002101100016002317100028002475200868002756500076011436510010012196530014012296550020012437730030012638560006012939030016012990344281  a199503       199408                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aFive Decades of Missing Females in China10aCoale, Ansley J.10aBanister, Judith  aPrinceton U  aUS Bureau of the Census  aThis paper seeks to explain the dearth of females in-the population of China in cohorts born from the late 1930s to the present. We demonstrate that in virtually all cohorts, the shortage of females in comparison with males is revealed when the cohort is first enumerated in a census. Subsequently it barely changes, an indication that female losses occur very early in life. Using the high-quality data from the censuses and fertility surveys in China, we show that many of the births of the girls missing in the censuses were not reported in the surveys because they died very young. The incidence of excess early female mortality (probably infanticide) declined precipitously in the Communist period, but not to zero. The recent escalation in the proportion of young females missing in China has been caused largely by rapidly escalating sex-elective abortion. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aChina  aFertility  aJournal Article  g31g3h459-79tDemography  iN  aAugust 199401674naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450113001441000022002571100009002795200935002886500076012236510010012996530011013096530013013206530015013336550020013487730030013688560006013989030016014040344282  a199503       199408                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aNonreporting of Births or Nonreporting of Pregnancies? Some Evidence from Four Rural Counties in North China10aSmith, Herbert L.  aU PA  aCoale and Banister argue that in China, elevated sex ratios in retrospective surveys are in part a function of collecting birth histories in a culture in which the definition of a birth may exclude mortality shortly after birth: an infant death in the West may be a stillbirth in east Asia. I present data from a recent sample survey featuring a retrospective pregnancy history. These data reveal that at least in the first pregnancy, from which the preponderance of sample births arise, there is no evidence of elevated female infant mortality or of high numbers of stillbirths, but that reported sex ratios are unusually high. The proportion of stillbirths grows for later pregnancies, but not enough to account for high sex ratios. Retrospective fertility data regarding recall over a recent interval are vexed less by a misunderstanding of what a live birth is than by a "misunderstanding" of what a (reportable) pregnancy is. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aChina  aBirths  a Infants  a Pregnancy  aJournal Article  g31g3h481-86tDemography  iN  aAugust 199400676naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450096001441000018002407000024002581100009002827100009002916500038003006510009003386530014003476550020003617730031003818560006004129030016004180344283  a199503       199408                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1210aDouble Jeopardy: Interaction Effects of Marital and Poverty Status on the Risk of Mortality10aSmith, Ken R.10aWaitzman, Norman J.  aU UT  aU UT 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aMortality  aJournal Article  g31g3h487-507tDemography  iN  aAugust 199401450naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450073001441000019002177000022002361100014002587100014002725200694002866500065009806510009010456530014010546530017010686530015010856550020011007730030011208560006011509030016011560344284  a199503       199408                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ6110aNativity Concentration and Internal Migration among the Foreign-Born10aKritz, Mary M.10aNogle, June Marie  aCornell U  aCornell U  aAre immigrants who live in states where large numbers of their compatriots reside more or less likely to migrate than those who live in other states? Using 1980 U.S. Census data to address that question, the analysis shows that nativity concentration deters interstate migration but not migration within the same state. Residing in a state where fellow nationals live is a more important determinant of internal migration than human capital, immigration status, or a state's unemployment rate. New York State residence in 1975 also promotes interstate migration. This research suggests that social dimensions should be taken into account in modeling internal migration of the foreign-born. 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  a Immigration  a Migration  aJournal Article  g31g3h509-24tDemography  iN  aAugust 199401334naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450041001441000015001851100031002005200685002316500065009166510009009816530015009906530015010056550020010207730030010408560006010709030016010760344285  a199503       199408                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ6110aOn the Measurement of Naturalization10aLiang, Zai  aQueens College and Brown U  aThis paper proposes a new way of measuring naturalization, which takes into account both emigration and death. I argue that the new method corrects for underestimation and thus provides a more accurate measure of the concept. Using data from six groups of the 1973 immigrant cohort and multiple-decrement life table techniques, I estimated and compared naturalization measures derived from new and old methods. The results show that failure to control for emigration has a significant effect on the measurement of naturalization, particularly if an immigrant group has relatively high rate of emigration. Some further substantive implications of this new method are also explored. 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.  aEmigration  a Immigrant  aJournal Article  g31g3h525-48tDemography  iN  aAugust 199401344naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450034001441000019001787000022001977000024002191100013002437100009002567100013002655200631002786500066009096510009009756530010009846550020009947730030010148560006010449030016010500344286  a199503       199408                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1610aIn Search of Asian War Brides10aSaenz, Rogelio10aHwang, Sean-Shong10aAguirre, Benigno E.  aTX A&M U  aU AL  aTX A&M U  aBecause of the long presence of U.S. soldiers in Asia, war-bride marriages involving servicemen and Asian women have been formed throughout the century.

This analysis develops a methodology to identify war brides and applies it to estimate the number of war brides from the six major Asian groups, using the national 1980 Public Use Microdata Sample. Further analysis comparing Asian war brides with other groups of Asian wives tends to support the traditional and lower socioeconomic images commonly associated with Asian war brides. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aWomen  aJournal Article  g31g3h549-59tDemography  iN  aAugust 199401444naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450107001441000019002517000019002701100047002897100005003365200636003416500076009776510023010536530017010766530015010936550020011087730031011288560006011599030013011650329808  a199412       199405                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1313aThe Demographic Transition in Southern Africa: Another Look at the Evidence from Botswana and Zimbabwe10aThomas, Duncan10aMuvandi, Ityai  aCentre for African Family Studies, Nairobi  a  aBotswana and Zimbabwe have been acclaimed as being on the vanguard of the demographic transition in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper examines the comparability of the CPS and the DHS data for each country and finds that part of the observed decline in aggregate fertility rates in both countries can be attributed to differences in sample composition. Women of the same cohort tend to be better educated in the second survey relative to the first. This fact explains part--but not all--of the observed fertility decline; for example, it appears to account for up to half the observed decline among women age 5-34 in 1984 in Zimbabwe. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aBotswana; Zimbabwe  aDemographics  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g31g2h185-207tDemography  iN  aMay 199400770naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450111001441000018002557000022002731100043002957100005003386500076003436510023004196530017004426550020004597730030004798560006005099030013005150329809  a199412       199405                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1313aThe Demographic Transition in Southern Africa: Yet Another Look at the Evidence from Botswana and Zimbabwe10aBlanc, Ann K.10aRutstein, Shea O.  aMacro International Inc, Calverton, MD  a 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aBotswana; Zimbabwe  aDemographics  aJournal Article  g31g2h209-15tDemography  iN  aMay 199400775naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450101001441000019002457000019002641100018002837100047003016500076003486510023004246530017004476550020004647730030004848560006005149030013005200329810  a199412       199405                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1313aThe Demographic Transition in Southern Africa: Reviewing the Evidence from Botswana and Zimbabwe10aThomas, Duncan10aMuvandi, Ityai  aRAND and UCLA  aCentre for African Family Studies, Nairobi 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aBotswana; Zimbabwe  aDemographics  aJournal Article  g31g2h217-27tDemography  iN  aMay 199401524naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450054001521000025002061100009002315200690002406500084009306500113010146510009011276530017011366530012011536530012011656550020011777730030011978560006012279030013012330329811  a199412       199405                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aQ21  aJ1510aEnvironmental Equity: The Demographics of Dumping10aAnderton, Douglas L.  aU MA  aResearch addressing "environmental equity" and "environmental racism" claims that facilities for treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous wastes (TSDFs) are located disproportionately in minority areas.

Measures of neighborhood characteristics consistent with our conceptualization are used to estimate the impact of context on mobility thoughts and on actual mobility in a sample of Nashville residents. Although individual statuses such as age and tenure remain important antecedents of mobility, subjective features of neighborhood context also play a role--albeit limited and indirect--in the decision to move or to stay. 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g31g2h249-70tDemography  iN  aMay 199401664naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450078001521000021002301100017002515200822002686500038010906500077011286510009012056530011012146530013012256530024012386530015012626530016012776550020012937730030013138560006013439030013013490329813  a199412       199405                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1110aPopulation Variation in Cause of Death: Level, Gender, and Period Effects10aGage, Timothy B.  aSUNY, Albany  aThe trends in 13 cause of death categories are examined with respect to expectation of life, sex differences, and period effects while misclassification of cause of death is controlled. The results suggest that as mortality declines, (1) the increasingly U-shaped age pattern of mortality is a period effect associated with the infectious diseases, (2) the risks of both overall infectious and degenerative causes of death decline, and (3) infectious disease mortality declines more in males, while degenerative disease mortality declines more in females. Finally, the model shows that some contemporary populations are approaching the limits of reduction in mortality during infancy, childhood, and young adulthood. Past declines in the degenerative diseases, however, suggest that mortality may continue to decline. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Disease  a Infectious Disease  a Mortality  a Population  aJournal Article  g31g2h271-96tDemography  iN  aMay 199400878naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450124001521000021002767000022002977000019003191100011003387100046003497100011003956500038004066500077004446510009005216550020005307730031005508560006005819030013005870329814  a199412       199405                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1110aEstimating Increment-Decrement Life Tables with Multiple Covariates from Panel Data: The Case of Active Life Expectancy10aLand, Kenneth C.10aGuralnik, Jack M.10aBlazer, Dan G.  aDuke U  aNational Institute on Aging, Bethesda, MD  aDuke U 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g31g2h297-319tDemography  iN  aMay 199401430naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450067001441000018002117000022002297000015002511100009002667100013002757100017002885200651003056500076009566510009010326530011010416530019010526550020010717730030010918560006011219030013011270329815  a199412       199405                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aModeling Seasonality in Fecundability, Conceptions, and Births10aLam, David A.10aMiron, Jeffrey A.10aRiley, Ann  aU MI  aBoston U  aGeorgetown U  aThis paper develops a model of seasonal fluctuations in fecundability, conceptions, and births.

The individual-level model is then expanded into a model of seasonal fluctuations in births at the population level, which accounts explicitly for seasonal fluctuations in the size of the susceptible population. We illustrate the use of the model by analyzing proposed explanations of birth seasonality that rely on extreme summer heat. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Contraception  aJournal Article  g31g2h321-46tDemography  iN  aMay 199400801naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450097001441000019002417000025002607000022002851100019003077100019003267100019003456500076003646510012004406530014004526550020004667730030004868560006005169030013005220329816  a199412       199405                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aFertility Decline in Prussia: Estimating Influences on Supply, Demand, and Degree of Control10aLee, Ronald D.10aGalloway, Patrick R.10aHammel, Eugene A.  aU CA, Berkeley  aU CA, Berkeley  aU CA, Berkeley 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aGermany  aFertility  aJournal Article  g31g2h347-73tDemography  iN  aMay 199401623naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450073001441000025002177000021002427000020002631100011002837100023002947100016003175200809003336500076011426510011012186530017012296530015012466550020012617730028012818560006013099030018013150348815  a199505       199402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aWhat Do We Know about the Timing of Fertility Transitions in Europe?10aGuinnane, Timothy W.10aOkun, Barbara S.10aTrussell, James  aYale U  aHebrew U Jerusalem  aPrinceton U  aThe Princeton project on the decline of fertility in Europe (the European Fertility Project) suggested that this historical fertility transition occurred virtually simultaneously in a wide variety of economic and social environments. This finding has been cited widely as evidence for an innovation/diffusion view of fertility transitions. We demonstrate that the demographic methods used to date the fertility transition in Europe--primarily I[subscript g], and (to a lesser extent) the Coale-Trussell M&m indices--may fail to detect the initial stages of a fertility transition and therefore cannot be used as the basis for strong statements about the timing of transitions. We review these measurement problems and their implications for the current understanding of the European fertility transition. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aEurope  aDemographics  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g31g1h1-20tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199401417naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450095001441000029002397000014002681100014002827100033002965200706003296500057010356510010010926550020011027730029011228560006011519030018011570348816  a199505       199402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1810aHousehold Registration Type and Compliance with the 'One Child' Policy in China, 1979-198810aCooney, Rosemary Santana10aLi, Jiali  aFordham U  aPopulation Council, New York  aThis research analyzes how a type of household registration, which reflects the degree of government control, affects compliance with China's "one child" policy for women at risk during the first decade of implementation. Although socioeconomic and cultural factors have significant effects on four fertility events after first live birth, household registration type is the most important. Furthermore, household registration type interacts with urbanization in such a way that the modernization influence associated with urbanization is more evident for women under less government control. The notable success of China's family planning program is linked to its unique system of government control. 4aDemographic Economics: Public Policy         b(J18)  aChina  aJournal Article  g31g1h21-32tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199401681naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450098001441000021002427000023002631100014002867100005003005200884003056500076011896510014012656530018012796530018012976530015013156550020013307730029013508560006013799030018013850348817  a199505       199402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aHow Economic Development and Family Planning Programs Combined to Reduce Indonesian Fertility10aGertler, Paul J.10aMolyneaux, John W.  aRAND Corp  a  aThis paper examines the contributions of family planning programs, economic development, and women's status to Indonesian fertility decline from 1982 to 1987. Methodologically we unify seemingly conflicting demographic and economic frameworks into a single "structural" proximate-cause model as well as controlling statistically for the targeted (nonrandom) placement of family planning program inputs. The results are consistent with both frameworks: 75 percent of the fertility decline resulted from increased contraceptive use, but was induced primarily through economic development and improved education and economic opportunities for females. Even so, the dramatic impact of the changes in demand-side factors (education and economic development) on contraceptive use was possible only because there already existed a highly responsive contraceptive supply delivery system. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aIndonesia  aContraceptive  a Demographics  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g31g1h33-63tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199401892naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450049001441000022001937000024002157000021002391100042002607100042003027100067003445200950004116500076013616510009014376530017014466530014014636530015014776530013014926550020015057730029015258560006015549030018015600348818  a199505       199402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aFamily Influences on Family Size Preferences10aAxinn, William G.10aClarkberg, Marin E.10aThornton, Arland  aPopulation Research Center, U Chicago  aPopulation Research Center, U Chicago  aInstitute for Social Research, Population Studies Center, U MI  aSeveral studies have demonstrated important effects of parents' childbearing behavior on their children's childbearing preferences and behavior. The study described here advances our understanding of these family influences by expanding the theoretical model to include parental preferences, siblings' behavior, and changes in children's preferences through early adulthood. Using intergenerational panel data from mothers and their children, we test the effects of both mothers' preferences for their own fertility and mothers' preferences for their children's fertility. Although both types of maternal preferences influence children's childbearing preferences, mothers' preferences for their children's behavior have the stronger and more proximate effects. Mothers' preferences continue to influence their children's preferences through early adulthood; siblings' fertility is an additional determinant of children's family size preferences. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildbearing  a Children  a Fertility  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g31g1h65-79tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199401354naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450076001441000018002207000022002381100009002607100009002695200663002786500038009416510009009796530014009886530013010026550020010157730029010358560006010649030018010700348819  a199505       199402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1210aLinked Lives, Dependent Demise?

Cigarette smoking, risk-avoidance behavior, poverty, and children are found to affect wives' and husbands' mortality in similar ways. Divorce, which can be interpreted as the termination of this shared household environment, is found to affect spouses differently. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aMortality  a Smoking  aJournal Article  g31g1h81-93tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199401657naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450086001441000019002307000020002491100014002697100023002835200914003066500108012206510013013286550020013417730030013618560006013919030018013970348820  a199505       199402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1410aLiving Arrangements of Older Malaysians: Who Coresides with Their Adult Children?10aDaVanzo, Julie10aChan, Angelique  aRAND Corp  aRAND Corp and UCLA  aMore than two-thirds of Malaysians age 60 or older co-reside with an adult child. Data from the Senior sample of the Second Malaysian Family Life Survey (MFLS-2) are used to investigate which "seniors" (persons age 60 or older) live in this way. The analysis generally supports the notion that co-residence is influenced by the benefits, costs, opportunities, and preferences for co-residence versus separate living arrangements. For example, married seniors are more likely to co-reside with adult children when housing costs are greater in their area or when the husband or wife is in poor health. This finding suggests that married parents and children live together to economize on living costs or to receive help with household services. Unmarried seniors who are better off economically are less likely to live with adult children, presumably because they use their higher incomes to "purchase privacy." 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aMalaysia  aJournal Article  g31g1h95-113tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199400670naa  2200217   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450072001441000025002161100036002416500076002776510012003536530013003656550020003787730030003988560006004289030018004340348821  a199505       199402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1313aThe Validity of Survey Responses on Abortion: Evidence from Estonia10aAnderson, Barbara A.  aPopulation Studies Center, U MI 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aEstonia  aAbortion  aJournal Article  g31g1h115-32tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199401638naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450088001441000022002321100046002545200942003006500066012426510016013086530010013246550020013347730030013548560006013849030018013900348822  a199505       199402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1610aMigration and the Latino Family: The Union Formation Behavior of Puerto Rican Women10aLandale, Nancy S.  aPopulation Research Institute, PA State U  aThis study examines the transition to first union among Puerto Rican women. I argue that understanding the behavior of mainland Puerto Ricans requires attention to family patterns in Puerto Rico and to the dynamics of migration between Puerto Rico and the United States. The study therefore is based on pooled data from comparable surveys undertaken in the two settings. These data allow for event history analyses that compare the union formation behavior of migrants with that of nonmigrants, and consider the role of migration in producing the observed union patterns. Multivariate models show that migrants are more likely than nonmigrants to form unions early and to enter informal unions. Additional analyses show that selective migration plays a role in producing this pattern. Overall the findings demonstrate the importance of using data from both origin and destination locales for understanding the behavior of migrant groups. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aPuerto Rico  aWomen  aJournal Article  g31g1h133-57tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199401724naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450109001441000024002537000021002777000020002981100045003187100046003637100045004095200773004546500038012276510009012656530011012746530021012856530015013066530015013216550020013367730030013568560006013869030018013920348823  a199505       199402                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1210aChanging Mortality and Morbidity Rates and the Health Status and Life Expectancy of the Older Population10aCrimmins, Eileen M.10aHayward, Mark D.10aSaito, Yasuhiko  aAndrus Gerontology Center, U Southern CA  aPopulation Research Institute, PA State U  aAndrus Gerontology Center, U Southern CA  aThis paper demonstrates the consequences of changes in mortality and health transition rates for changes in both health status life expectancy and the prevalence of health problems in the older population. A five-state multistate life table for the mid-1980s provides the baseline for estimating the effect of differing mortality and morbidity schedules. Results show that improving mortality alone implies increases in both the years and the proportion of dependent life; improving morbidity alone reduces both the years and the proportion of dependent life. Improving mortality alone leads to a higher prevalence of dependent individuals in the life table population; improving morbidity alone leads to a lower percentage of individuals with problems in functioning. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aU.S.  aHealth  a Morbidity Rates  a Morbidity  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g31g1h159-75tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199400701naa  2200217   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450126001441000024002701100009002946500076003036530015003796530015003946550020004097730030004298560006004599030018004650321386  a199406       199311                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aFertility and Family Planning among the Elderly in Taiwan, or Integrating the Demography of Aging into Population Studies10aHermalin, Albert I.  aU MI 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aDemography  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g30g4h507-18tDemography  iN  aNovember 199300628naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450028001521000021001801100014002016500043002156500051002586530015003096550020003247730030003448560006003749030018003800321387  a199406       199311                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aA14  aJ1010aHow Demography Was Born10aBogue, Donald J.  aU Chicago 4aSociology of Economics         b(A14) 4aDemographic Economics: General         b(J10)  aDemography  aJournal Article  g30g4h519-21tDemography  iN  aNovember 199301428naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450031001521000021001837000021002047000024002251100009002497100009002587100009002675200653002766500043009296500051009726530015010236530014010386550020010527730030010728560006011029030018011080321388  a199406       199311                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aA14  aJ1010aThirty Years of Demography10aTeachman, Jay D.10aPaasch, Kathleen10aCarver, Karen Price  aU MD  aU MD  aU MD  aIn this paper, we present a content analysis of DEMOGRAPHY, the official journal of the Population Association of America.

The data suggest that the field of population research has become increasingly bureaucratized and complex, while at the same time continuing to focus on familiar research subjects. A relatively small number of population research centers contribute disproportionately to the journal. 4aSociology of Economics         b(A14) 4aDemographic Economics: General         b(J10)  aDemography  a Journals  aJournal Article  g30g4h523-32tDemography  iN  aNovember 199300697naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450046001521000020001981100066002186500043002846500051003276530015003786550020003937730030004138560006004439030018004490321389  a199406       199311                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aA14  aJ1010aThirty Years of Demography and Demography10aKeyfitz, Nathan  aInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Austria 4aSociology of Economics         b(A14) 4aDemographic Economics: General         b(J10)  aDemography  aJournal Article  g30g4h533-49tDemography  iN  aNovember 199300720naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450083001521000025002351100009002606500043002696500066003126530015003786530011003936550020004047730030004248560006004549030018004600321390  a199406       199311                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aA14  aJ1610aIf All We Knew about Women Was What We Read in Demography, What Would We Know?10aWatkins, Susan Cotts  aU PA 4aSociology of Economics         b(A14) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aDemography  a Women  aJournal Article  g30g4h551-77tDemography  iN  aNovember 199300595naa  2200205   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450063001441000024002071100018002316500051002496530015003006550020003157730030003358560006003659030018003710321391  a199406       199311                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1010aDemography: The Past 30 Years, the Present, and the Future10aCrimmins, Eileen M.  aU Southern CA 4aDemographic Economics: General         b(J10)  aDemography  aJournal Article  g30g4h579-91tDemography  iN  aNovember 199301429naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450058001441000023002021100009002255200806002346500051010406530017010916530016011086550020011247730031011448560006011759030018011810321392  a199406       199311                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1013aThe Contours of Demography: Estimates and Projections10aPreston, Samuel H.  aU PA  aThis paper considers the scope of demography and the various research approaches that legitimately could claim the label. As a small field lacking security in academic structures, demography has been unusually sensitive to demand factors, including those associated with perceived population problems. International health is cited as an area of increased demographic presence; reasons for this development are explored. The technology for performing research in demogrpahy is improving more rapidly than in many other areas of the social sciences, and thus is helping to improve the relative standing of the field. Taking a demand-oriented approach, the paper identifies several promising research areas in which demographers will be called on to address issues of national and international concern. 4aDemographic Economics: General         b(J10)  aDemographics  a Demography  aJournal Article  g30g4h593-606tDemography  iN  aNovember 199302082naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450066001601000018002267000023002441100017002677100014002845201032002986500048013306500077013786500172014556510009016276530017016366530016016536530013016696550020016827730030017028560006017329030018017380321393  a199406       199311                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI31  aJ11  aR2313aThe Link between Population Density and Welfare Participation10aRank, Mark R.10aHirschl, Thomas A.  aWashington U  aCornell U  aThis article explores a neglected topic in the social welfare, poverty, and demographic literatures--the link between population density and welfare participation in the United States. Longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics are used to meet two objectives: first, to test whether a relationship exists between population density and use of the food stamp program among eligible households; second, to explore the potential reasons for such a relationship. Our findings show that population density has a strong, positive impact on the likelihood of participating in the food stamp program. Low-income respondents in urban areas are significantly more likely to use food stamps in both an aggregate and a multivariate context. In analyzing the dynamic underlying such an effect, we find that those in urban areas are more likely to possess accurate eligibility information and to hold less adverse attitudes toward the use of welfare. These factors in turn increase the likelihood of food stamp participation. 4aGeneral Welfare; Well-Being         b(I31) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aDemographics  a Population  a Welfare  aJournal Article  g30g4h607-22tDemography  iN  aNovember 199301343naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450035001441000019001791100013001985200695002116500084009066510009009906530015009996530013010146550020010277730030010478560006010779030018010830321394  a199406       199311                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aQ2113aThe Human Ecology of Tornadoes10aAguirre, B. E.  aTX A&M U  aThis paper offers an empirical test of the impact of human ecological patterns and other known correlates on tornado occurrence. It uses the National Severe Storms Forecast Center's information on tornadoes from 1950 through 1990 and employs ecological data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the Environmental Protection Agency. The results show that metropolitan and other urban counties have higher odds of tornado occurrence than rural counties, and that the probability of occurrence of tornadoes increases with increases in the number of previous tornadoes. The paper assesses the meaning of this finding for demographers, atmospheric scientists, engineers, and disaster managers. 4aRenewable Resources and Conservation: Demand and Supply; Prices         b(Q21)  aU.S.  aEcological  a Ecology  aJournal Article  g30g4h623-33tDemography  iN  aNovember 199301416naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450070001441000019002141100009002335200669002426500077009116510009009886530011009976530012010086530013010206530015010336530016010486550020010647730030010848560006011149030018011200321395  a199406       199311                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1110aChanging Identification among American Indians and Alaska Natives10aEschbach, Karl  aU WI  aThe census-enumerated American Indian population dispersed rapidly between 1930 and 1990. Changes in ethnic classification account for most of the change. In the 1980 count, 10 states with historically large Indian populations account for 53 percent of births of Indians between the ages of 10 and 80, compared with 72 percent of the first enumerations of the same cohorts. Migration further reduced the share of these states to 46 percent of Indian residents in these cohorts. Study of the dispersal of the Indian population should focus primarily on the new emergence of the expression of Indian identity, rather than on migration from former population centers. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Census  a Cohorts  a Migration  a Population  aJournal Article  g30g4h635-52tDemography  iN  aNovember 199300714naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450065001441000020002097000020002291100021002497100023002706500084002936510009003776530012003866550020003987730030004188560006004489030018004540321396  a199406       199311                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1211aA Joint Model of Marital Childbearing and Marital Disruption10aLillard, Lee A.10aWaite, Linda J.  aRAND Corporation  aNORC and U Chicago 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aMarital  aJournal Article  g30g4h653-81tDemography  iN  aNovember 199301417naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450062001441000026002067000021002327000025002531100012002787100009002907100009002995200684003086500076009926510009010686550020010777730030010978560006011279030018011330321397  a199406       199311                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1311aA Portrait of the Nest-Leaving Process in Early Adulthood10aGoldscheider, Frances10aThornton, Arland20aYoung-DeMarco, Linda  aBrown U  aU MI  aU MI  aThis paper provides an in-depth portrait of the nest-leaving process in early adulthood as it emerged in the 1980s. Event histories are used to describe transitions in and out of the parental home during the years from age 15 through age 23. We focus on the role of the "new" forms of living arrangements in the leaving-home process, namely nonfamily living and cohabitation. The results show that the transition to full residential independence is more gradual, with more intermediate steps, than previous studies suggested. Cohabitation is rare as a route out of the parental home, and both nonfamily living and cohabitation lead to much higher return rates than does marriage. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g30g4h683-99tDemography  iN  aNovember 199301311naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450093001521000026002451100015002715200510002866500076007966500042008726510009009146530011009236530014009346530011009486550020009597730030009798560006010099030018010150321398  a199406       199311                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aI2110aSimplicity and Complexity in the Effects of Parental Structure on High School Graduation10aWojtkiewicz, Roger A.  aLA State U  aAs more and more children experience nonintact families because of nonmarital birth or parental marital disruption, researchers have paid more attention to whether nonintact family experiences have negative effects on later life. This study uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to consider how experiences of parental structure affect changes of high school graduation. The study shows that the negative effects of parental structure are simpler than theoretical notions might suggest. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Children  a Youth  aJournal Article  g30g4h701-17tDemography  iN  aNovember 199300673naa  2200217   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450098001441000025002421100009002676500084002766510009003606530012003696550020003817730030004018560006004319030018004370321399  a199406       199311                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aEnforcing Divorce Settlements: Evidence from Child Support Compliance and Award Modifications10aPeters, H.

For both sexes, the proportion ever marrying declined and the average age at first marriage rose. The 1988 rates imply that 43 percent of marriages end in divorce. That represents a slight decline from the 1983 figure, and suggests that divorce has peaked at a level below that estimated in earlier analyses. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aDivorce  a Marital  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g30g4h737-46tDemography  iN  aNovember 199301731naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450065001521000027002171100009002445201035002536500066012886500049013546510013014036550020014167730031014368560006014679030016014730297944  a199403       199308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aJ1910aSexual Activity among Never-Married Men in Northern Thailand10aVanLandingham, Mark J.  aU WA  aWe use data collected in 1991 to investigate sexual activity among never-married men in Thailand, with a focus on age at first intercourse, characteristics of sexual partners, and conditions under which men visit prostitutes. We sampled men from a broad spectrum of northern Thai society, including university undergraduates, soldiers, and semi-skilled/unskilled workers. We found that except for the students, the majority of each subsample is sexually experienced; prostitutes are the most common type of sexual partner for all groups. Alcohol consumption is associated with several measures of sexual activity. Condom use with prostitutes varies among the subsamples. Among men who have both prostitute and nonprostitute partners, the majority of those who do not use condoms with prostitutes also do not use condoms with their nonprostitute partners. We consider the implications of these results for the AIDS epidemic in Thailand.

The analysis sample includes 2,648 Filipino women followed for 24 months postpartum. Recently devised statistical estimation techniques to control for unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity are employed in estimating a two-state hazard model. Low body mass index and lower dietary fat intake are associated with increased duration of postpartum amenorrhea. Contraceptive use, high dietary fat consumption, higher parity, and absence of spouse predict a longer waiting time to conception once menses have returned. Simulation of the hazard model is used to examine the effects of the key nutrition and lactation factors. Coauthors are David K. Guilkey, John S. Akin, Linda S. Adair, J.

Broadened opportunities for women outside marriage may have alleviated some of the severe economic costs of marital disruption for women. This paper contrasts the experiences of two cohorts of young women: those who married and separated or divorced in the late 1960s through the mid-1970s and those who experienced these events in the 1980s. Based on panel data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth 1979-88, Young Women 1968-78, and Young Men 1966-78, the results show stability in the costs of disruption. A multivariate analysis shows that young women in the more recent cohort have more labor force experience before disruption than those in the earlier cohort, but prior work history does not protect women from the severe costs of marital disruption. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aDivorce  a Marital  a Marriage  a Women  aJournal Article  g30g3h353-71tDemography  iN  aAugust 199301526naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450050001441000020001941100013002145200891002276500084011186510009012026530013012116550020012247730030012448560006012749030016012800297948  a199403       199308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aCatholicism and Marriage in the United States10aSander, William  aDePaul U  aThis study examines the effects of a Catholic background on age at first marriage, the odds of never marrying, and the odds of ever divorcing. Estimates using Catholic upbringing are compared with estimates using Catholic at the time of the survey. A case is made that if the latter measure of Catholicism is used, serious selection bias problems occur in some cases because this measure excludes defectors and includes converts. Further, it is shown that a Catholic upbringing generally has no effect on men's age at first marriage and has a positive effect on the age when women marry. It is also shown that older Baptist men are substantially more likely than Catholic men to experience a divorce. Older Catholic women are somewhat less likely to experience a divorce than non-Baptist Protestant women. There is no Catholic effect on the odds that younger men and women will divorce. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aMarriage  aJournal Article  g30g3h373-84tDemography  iN  aAugust 199301750naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450051001441000022001957000024002171100018002417100018002595201015002776500084012926510009013766530013013856530013013986550020014117730031014318560006014629030016014680297949  a199403       199308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aReligion as a Determinant of Marital Stability10aLehrer, Evelyn L.10aChiswick, Carmel U.  aU IL, Chicago  aU IL, Chicago  aUsing data from the 1987-88 National Survey of Families and Households, this paper studies the role of the religious composition of union as a determinant of marital stability. With the exceptions of Mormons and individuals with no religious identification, stability is found to be remarkably similar across the various types of homogamous unions. Consistent with the notion that religion is a complementary marital trait, interfaith unions have generally higher rates of dissolution than intrafaith unions. The destabilizing effect of out-marriage varies inversely with the similarity in beliefs and practices of the two religions as well as with the mutual tolerance embodied in their respective doctrines. The results also suggest that religious compatibility between spouses at the time of marriage has a large influence on marital stability, rivaling in magnitude that of age at marriage and, at least for Protestants and Catholics, dominating any adverse effects of differences in religious backgrounds. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aFamilies  a Marital  aJournal Article  g30g3h385-404tDemography  iN  aAugust 199301954naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450061001681000018002297000017002477000018002641100022002827100016003047100016003205200867003366500038012036500160012416500049014016500034014506510009014846530013014936530014015066550020015207730030015408560006015709030016015760297950  a199403       199308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aN33  aJ19  aI1913aThe Dynamics of Smallpox Epidemics in Britain, 1550-180010aDuncan, S.

The interepidemic period was found to be two years in London and five years in Penrith. Equations governing the dynamics of epidemics predict (1) a two-year periodicity and (2) that oscillatory epidemics die out quickly. It is suggested that epidemics were maintained by a periodic variation in susceptibility linked either to a five-year cycle of malnutrition or to an annual cycle. Computer modeling shows how the very different patterns of epidemics are related to population size and to the magnitude of the oscillation in susceptibility. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Europe: Pre-1913         b(N33) 4aDemographic Economics: Other         b(J19) 4aHealth: Other         b(I19)  aU.K.  aEpidemic  a Smallpox  aJournal Article  g30g3h405-23tDemography  iN  aAugust 199301318naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450105001521000022002577000018002791100056002977100045003535200401003986500084007996500057008836510016009406530012009566550020009687730030009888560006010189030016010240297951  a199403       199308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1810aMeasuring the Effect of Changing Legislation on the Frequency of Divorce: The Netherlands, 1830-199010avan Poppel, Frans10ade Beer, Joop  aNetherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute  aNetherlands Central Bureau of Statistics  aThis article discusses different procedures for measuring the effects of judicial changes on divorce rates.

The analysis employs a complex register of population constructed from census enumerations, civil and ecclesiastical vital registration, and tax assessment rolls. The article begins with a series of bivariate analyses with cohort of mother's birth, religion, ethnicity, and husband's occupation determining marital fertility. The second half of the paper presents a multivariate model of the determinants of fertility using these and other demographic characteristics as independent variables. The conclusions emphasize the importance of the overall trend toward fertility decline in the United States, as well as the role of religion and of occupational differences, in determining changes in fertility behavior in the population of Gillespie County, Texas. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Fertility  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g30g3h443-57tDemography  iN  aAugust 199301606naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450101001441000020002457000018002651100028002837100032003115200852003436500038011956510009012336530011012426530015012536550020012687730030012888560006013189030016013240297953  a199403       199308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1210aUsing Survey Data to Assess Neonatal Tetanus Mortality Levels and Trends in Developing Countries10aBoerma, J.

We analyze birth history data from 37 national surveys in developing countries to assess the quality of neonatal mortality data and to estimate levels and trends in mortality occurring at 4-14 days. It is shown that mortality at 4-14 days has declined considerably during the last decade in most developing countries, concomitant with development and expansion of programs to reduce neonatal tetanus. These declines show that reductions in neonatal tetanus mortality probably have been an important contributor to the decline of neonatal and infant mortality during the 1980s. 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aLDCs  aHealth  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g30g3h459-75tDemography  iN  aAugust 199301498naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450071001521000022002231100016002455200721002616500038009826500076010206510015010966530011011116530011011226530015011336550020011487730030011688560006011989030016012040297954  a199403       199308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1310aSiblings' Neonatal Mortality Risks and Birth Spacing in Bangladesh10aZenger, Elizabeth  aPrinceton U  aThis paper studies the familial association of neonatal mortality in Matlab, Bangladesh and its relationship to birth-spacing effects on mortality. Findings show that familial association is strongest for siblings of adjacent birth orders. Moreover, birth-spacing effects on neonatal mortality are stronger when the preceding child has survived the neonatal period than when it has died. Transitional (Markov), random-effects, and marginal models for correlated data are introduced, and are contrasted in interpretation and technique. Familial association of neonatal mortality can be approximated well by a first-order Markov model using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to allow for higher-order correlation. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aBangladesh  aBirths  a Child  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g30g3h477-88tDemography  iN  aAugust 199300656naa  2200217   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450072001441000023002161100030002396500076002696510009003456530011003546550020003657730031003858560006004169030016004220297955  a199403       199308                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aRace, Intervening Variables, and Two Components of Low Birth Weight10aKallan, Jeffrey E.  aNational Research Council 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirths  aJournal Article  g30g3h489-506tDemography  iN  aAugust 199301537naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450070001441000024002141100049002385200765002876500076010526510011011286530011011396530019011506530018011696530015011876550020012027730030012228560006012529030013012580293849  a199312       199305                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aNew Zodiacal Influences on Chinese Family Formation: Taiwan, 197610aGoodkind, Daniel M.  aNational Center for Social Sciences, Vietnam  aAlthough Chinese folklore holds that the Dragon Year is an auspicious time to have a birth, notable increases in Chinese fertility in Dragon Years did not occur before 1976. Demographic explanations for the belated occurrence of this phenomenon rely on the notion of natural fertility: that is, couples' lack of modern contraception had kept such decisions outside the realm of choice. The decomposition performed in this article, however, shows that the bulk of the 1976 Dragon Year baby boom on Taiwan was due to strategies that had always been available: marriage timing, abortion, and coital behavior. The natural fertility paradigm thus is insufficient in explaining the motivation for this behavior and should be complemented by institutional approaches. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aTaiwan  aBirths  a Contraception  a Demographics  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g30g2h127-42tDemography  iN  aMay 199301518naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450067001441000021002117000017002321100022002497100018002715200779002896500076010686510013011446530011011576530015011686550020011837730030012038560006012339030013012390293850  a199312       199305                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aFertility in Botswana: The Recent Decline and Future Prospects10aRutenberg, Naomi10aDiamond, Ian  aThe Futures Group  aU Southampton  aRecent estimates of fertility in Botswana suggest a rapid decline of more than two births per woman between 1981 and 1988. This paper proposes that the baseline fertility was overestimated but that nonetheless fertility declined by about one birth per woman during the 1980s. The decline in fertility was linked to a deterioration in social and economic conditions caused by a major drought in the early 1980s and to the increased availability of family planning services in the same period. Fertility apparently began to rebound in the late 1980s in response to improved conditions, which came about as a result of a successful drought relief program. Future declines in fertility depend on the continued success of the family planning program, particularly in rural areas. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aBotswana  aBirths  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g30g2h143-57tDemography  iN  aMay 199300774naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450105001441000018002497000024002677000023002911100017003147100009003317100020003406500076003606510015004366550020004517730030004718560006005019030013005070293851  a199312       199305                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1311aA New Look at the Determinants of Nonnumeric Response to Desired Family Size: The Case of Costa Rica10aRiley, Ann P.10aHermalin, Albert I.20aRosero-Bixby, Luis  aGeorgetown U  aU MI  aU de Costa Rica 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aCosta Rica  aJournal Article  g30g2h159-74tDemography  iN  aMay 199301558naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450105001521000016002577000021002731100009002947100009003035200692003126500084010046500076010886510010011646530011011746530014011856550020011997730030012198560006012499030013012550293852  a199312       199305                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aWriting the Names: Marriage Style, Living Arrangements, and First Birth Interval in a Nepali Society10aFricke, Tom10aTeachman, Jay D.  aU MI  aU MD  aUsing data from a Nepali population, this analysis argues that marriage style and postmarital living arrangements affect coital frequency to produce variations in the timing of first birth after marriage. Event history analysis of the first birth interval for 149 women suggests that women's autonomy in marriage decisions and marriage to cross-cousins accelerate the pace of entry into first birth. Extended-household residence with reduced natal kin contact, on the other hand, significantly lengthens the first birth interval. These findings are consistent with previous arguments in the literature while offering new evidence for the impact of extended-family residence on fertility. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aNepal  aBirths  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g30g2h175-88tDemography  iN  aMay 199301641naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450072001521000020002241100016002445200882002606500084011426500038012266530012012646530014012766530015012906550020013057730031013258560006013569030013013620293853  a199312       199305                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aI1210aMarriage Selection and Mortality Patterns: Inferences and Fallacies10aGoldman, Noreen  aPrinceton U  aResearchers have long wondered whether marital-status differences in mortality arise largely from selection mechanisms or from causal processes typically known as marriage protection. Unfortunately, many investigators have relied on aggregate patterns of mortality differentials--such as age schedules of excess mortality in the single population or the relationship between the level of excess mortality and the relative size of the single population--to make inferences about the relative importance of selection and causal processes. In this paper, a simple mathematical simulation model is used to demonstrate that many inferences derived from observed patterns are simply not justified. This finding highlights the importance of prospective data for assessing the relative importance of selection and causal factors in accounting for the excess mortality of the unmarried. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aMarital  a Marriage  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g30g2h189-208tDemography  iN  aMay 199301776naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450072001521000018002241100009002425200932002516500108011836500066012916510014013576530010013716530013013816530012013946530011014066550020014177730030014378560006014679030013014730293854  a199312       199305                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ14  aJ1610aGender Differences in Economic Well-Being among the Elderly of Java10aRudkin, Laura  aU NC  aWith populations aging rapidly in many developing nations, issues of economic dependency among the elderly are of increasing importance. Using data from a 1986 survey of the elderly on Java, Indonesia, I describe gender differences in economic well-being and identify characteristics associated with economic disadvantage. At both the individual and the household level, older women have fewer resources than older men. Even within categories of support (work income and remittances), women have lower levels of well-being. Gender differences in household-level economic well-being are due primarily to differences in household structure and in levels of skills, Gender differences in individual receipts (from all sources) are more complicated, but can be understood more clearly with reference to gender differences in skills levels (literacy, language, job skills), current work status and authority, and domestic authority. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aIndonesia  aAging  a Elderly  a Gender  a Women  aJournal Article  g30g2h209-26tDemography  iN  aMay 199301895naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450069001601000024002297000021002531100009002747100009002835200959002926500076012516500084013276500066014116510009014776530013014866530013014996550020015127730030015328560006015629030013015680293855  a199312       199305                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ12  aJ1610aIncome Growth among Nonresident Fathers: Evidence from Wisconsin10aPhillips, Elizabeth10aGarfinkel, Irwin  aU WI  aU WI  aThis study examines the changes over time in the personal incomes of nonresident fathers--whether divorced or nonmarital--in Wisconsin. Using data from the Wisconsin Court Record data base and the Wisconsin Department of Revenue, the authors examine the incomes of these fathers over the first seven years following a divorce or the initiation of a paternity suit. They also study separately the income patterns of initially poor nonresident fathers and fathers whose nonresident children receive welfare. The most important finding is that the incomes of nonmarital fathers, which typically are low in the beginning, increase dramatically over the years after paternity establishment--often to a level comparable with the incomes of divorced fathers. On the basis of their findings, the authors conclude that failing to establish child support obligations for nonresident fathers simply because their incomes are initially low does not appear justified. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aChildren  a Divorce  aJournal Article  g30g2h227-41tDemography  iN  aMay 199301714naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450089001521000019002417000021002601100017002817100017002985200719003156500113010346500172011476510009013196530015013286530012013436550020013557730030013758560006014059030013014110293856  a199312       199305                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aR2310aLocational Returns to Human Capital: Minority Access to Suburban Community Resources10aLogan, John R.10aAlba, Richard D.  aSUNY, Albany  aSUNY, Albany  aThe suburbanization of racial and ethnic minorities is analyzed in terms of the locational resources provided by their communities of residence. In suburbs in the New York CMSA, non-Hispanic whites and Asians, on average, live in communities with higher average socioeconomic status, while Hispanics and blacks live in the less desirable suburbs. Models predicting suburban socioeconomic status for each racial/ethnic group show that whites and Hispanics receive consistent returns on income, acculturation, and family status. Asians' locational patterns differ because they are unrelated to measures of acculturation; for blacks, locational outcomes correspond least to any of these human capital characteristics. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aMinorities  a Racial  aJournal Article  g30g2h243-68tDemography  iN  aMay 199300891naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450039001521000020001917000019002111100022002307100022002526500113002746500172003876510009005596550020005687730030005888560006006189030013006240293857  a199312       199305                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aR2310aBlack Suburbanization in the 1980s10aSchneider, Mark10aPhelan, Thomas  aSUNY, Stony Brook  aSUNY, Stony Brook 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Regional Labor Markets; Population; Neighborhood Characteristics         b(R23)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g30g2h269-79tDemography  iN  aMay 199300710naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450081001441000025002257000022002501100009002727100016002816500076002976510009003736530017003826550020003997730030004198560006004499030013004550293858  a199312       199305                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1313aThe Socioeconomic Costs of Teenage Childbearing: Evidence and Interpretation10aGeronimus, Arline T.10aKorenman, Sanders  aU MI  aPrinceton U 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildbearing  aJournal Article  g30g2h281-90tDemography  iN  aMay 199300747naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450061001441000021002057000023002267000026002491100009002757100017002847100009003016500076003106510009003866530017003956550020004127730030004328560006004629030013004680293859  a199312       199305                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aReevaluating the Costs of Teenage Childbearing: Response10aHoffman, Saul D.10aFoster, E.

Recently, however, several researchers have argued that the apparent negative effects of teenage childbearing primarily reflect unmeasured family background rather than the true consequences of a teen birth. To distinguish the effect of teen childbearing from that of family background, we use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and compare teen mothers with their sisters. We find that accounting for unobserved family background reduces, but does not eliminate, the estimated consequences of early childbearing. Statistically significant and quantitatively important effects of teen parenthood remain for high school graduation, family size, and economic well-being. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Childbearing  a Children  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g30g1h1-13tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199301363naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450074001521000015002261100009002415200621002506500038008716500076009096510014009856530010009996530015010096550020010247730029010448560006010739030018010790289190  a199309       199302                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1310aUse of Sibling Data to Estimate Family Mortality Effects in Guatemala10aGuo, Guang  aU NC  aThis paper examines the potential bias in estimates of child mortality determinants produced by the questionable assumption that sibling data are independent and estimates the unmeasured familial effects shared among siblings. The parameter estimates yielded by the multivariate hazard model are very similar to those yielded by the standard hazard model. The standard errors of the parameter estimates, however, tend to be underestimated in conventional analyses. The contribution to child mortality from the familial factors seems modest net of household socioeconomic status, at least in this Guatemalan data set. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aGuatemala  aChild  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g30g1h15-32tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199301402naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450074001521000020002267000017002467000022002631100018002857100018003037100018003215200525003396500076008646500038009406510011009786530011009896530015010006550020010157730029010358560006010649030018010700289191  a199309       199302                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aI1210aBirth Interval and Family Effects on Postneonatal Mortality in Brazil10aCurtis, Sian L.10aDiamond, Ian10aMcDonald, John W.  aU Southampton  aU Southampton  aU Southampton  aIn this paper random-effects logistic models are used to analyze the effects of the preceding birth interval on postneonatal mortality in Brazil, controlling for the correlation of survival outcomes between siblings.

Furthermore, women differ in their effective fecundability: some women have persistently low or high monthly chances of live-birth conception. Estimates are presented concerning the magnitude of these effects in a natural-fertility population: 406 Hutterite women in North America who had 3,206 births, largely in the 1940s and 1950s. The estimates are based on models that incorporate the effects of persistent heterogeneity and that use the full information provided by multiple-spell duration data. In addition, hazards rather than probabilities are modeled, piecewise linear hazard functions are used, and age and parity effects are decomposed systematically. These methods permit the development of more elaborate models of changing fecundability and of heterogeneity in postpartum amenorrhea. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.; Canada  aBirths  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g30g1h81-102tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199302035naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450091001601000022002517000023002731100015002967100017003115200979003286500084013076500044013916500097014356510009015326530014015416530017015556530013015726530014015856530012015996550020016117730030016318560006016619030018016670289195  a199309       199302                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aF22  aN2110aGeneration, Ethnicity, and Marriage: Historical Patterns in the Northern United States10aLandale, Nancy S.10aTolnay, Stewart E.  aPA State U  aSUNY, Albany  aImmigration was a prominent feature of American life during the early decades of the twentieth century. About 40 percent of the white population was of foreign birth or parentage, and immigrants were increasingly from diverse national origins. Using data from the Public Use Micordata Sample of the 1910 U.S. Census, we examine generational and ethnic differences in marital timing. The analysis reveals a striking pattern of delayed marriage among native whites with foreign parents, but marked ethnic variation in the extent of marriage delay within the second generation. We hypothesize that locational factors, especially diverse economic opportunities, were important in shaping this marriage pattern. Separate multilevel analyses are conducted for females and for males living in urban and in rural places. Although significant effects for a variety of contextual factors are found, generational and ethnic differences in nuptial timing persist in multivariate models. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aEconomic History: Financial Markets and Institutions: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N21)  aU.S.  aImmigrant  a Immigration  a Marital  a Marriage  a Parent  aJournal Article  g30g1h103-26tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199301269naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450057001441000026002011100009002275200624002366500076008606530013009366530015009496550020009647730031009848560006010159030018010210276773  a199306       199211                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aFertility Transition, Conscious Choice, and Numeracy10avan de Walle, Etienne  aU PA  aOne of the preconditions of the fertility transition, as stated by A. J. Coale, is that reproductive decisions must be within the calculus of conscious choice. It is suggested that the change in mentality which leads to family limitation includes "numeracy about children," a clear notion of what family size ought to be and the awareness of individuals of where they stand with respect to the norm. The article explores the hypothesis that numeracy about children appeared historically in various times and places, and that the conceptualization of family size was a necessary condition for adopting family limitation. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aChildren  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g29g4h487-502tDemography  iN  aNovember 199201376naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450058001441000022002021100014002245200734002386500076009726510010010486530014010586550020010727730030010928560006011229030018011280276774  a199306       199211                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aFamily Organization and Fertility Limitation in Nepal10aAxinn, William G.  aU Chicago  aThis paper uses the family mode of organization framework to link together hypotheses relating social change to fertility limitation. Experiences in nonfamily activities are predicted to affect fertility behavior, with the outcome depending on the social, economic, and cultural context. To provide individual-level tests of hypotheses, the paper uses data from a Nepalese community which recently began dramatic family and fertility transitions. The findings show that experiences in nonfamily activities before marriage increase the odds of subsequently adopting fertility limitation in this setting. The evidence also demonstrates the importance of including measures of husbands' experiences in models of fertility decisions. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aNepal  aFertility  aJournal Article  g29g4h503-21tDemography  iN  aNovember 199201881naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450083001601000027002437000020002701100021002907100022003115200827003336500066011606500076012266500053013026510009013556530010013646530014013746530015013886530018014036530013014216530011014346550020014457730030014658560006014959030018015010276775  a199306       199211                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aJ13  aJ2213aThe Perceived Impact of Child Care Costs on Women's Labor Supply and Fertility10aMason, Karen Oppenheim10aKuhlthau, Karen  aEast-West Center  aMA Dept of Health  aIn a sample of Detroit-area mothers of preschool-aged children interviewed in 1986, one-third reported that child care problems had constrained their employment. Such reports were relatively prevalent among poor women, those without relatives nearby, and those willing to entrust the care of their children to nonfamily members. Only one-tenth of the sample reported a similar child care constraint on fertility, a phenomenon unrelated to income but relatively prevalent among women with strong labor force attachment. The results suggest that policies to increase the supply of child care or to lower its cost could increase female labor supply by a substantial fraction with an even greater rise among women most at risk of poverty and reliance on public assistance, but probably would not raise fertility significantly. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Fertility  a Labor Supply  a Mothers  a Women  aJournal Article  g29g4h523-43tDemography  iN  aNovember 199201919naa  2200385   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450086001681000021002541100041002755200761003166500066010776500076011436500053012196500065012726510011013376530011013486530011013596530018013706530014013886530014014026530013014166530019014296530011014486550020014597730030014798560006015099030018015150276776  a199306       199211                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ16  aJ13  aJ22  aJ3110aForgone Labor Participation and Earning Due to Childbearing among Norwegian Women10aKravdal, Oystein  aCentral Bureau of Statistics, Norway  aIndividual-level retrospective data from the Family and Occupation Survey of 1988 are used to assess the time diverted from gainful employment because of the presence of children in two Norwegian birth cohorts. We find that a two-child mother born in 1950, whose births occurred in her early twenties, lost 6.6 woman-years up to age 37, compared to a childless woman. By matching information on registered income with the survey data, we estimate that her lost income amounts to $151,000 at 1990 prices. After taxation the loss is $98,000. Women with fewer than 12 years of schooling seem to forgo more labor market activity by reason of childbearing than do their better-educated counterparts. The pattern is less clear with respect to the loss of income. 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31)  aNorway  aBirths  a Child  a Childbearing  a Children  a Earnings  a Mothers  a Participation  a Women  aJournal Article  g29g4h545-63tDemography  iN  aNovember 199201483naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450092001521000021002441100035002655200628003006500108009286500038010366510009010746530020010836530015011036530013011186550020011317730030011518560006011819030018011870276777  a199306       199211                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ14  aI1211aA Description of the Extreme Aged Population Based on Improved Medicare Enrollment Data10aKestenbaum, Bert  aSocial Security Administration  aThe mortality and size of the extreme aged population can be studied most accurately with Medicare enrollment data from the Social Security Administration's Master Beneficiary Record after certain types of questionable records are eliminated.

This paper examines the level of mortality in Liberia of Africans who emigrated there from the United States. A life table is estimated from data collected by the American Colonization Society from 1820 to 1843. The analysis reflects the mortality experience of a population that is transplanted from one disease environment to another, more exacting, disease environment. The results of this analysis show that these Liberian immigrants experienced the highest mortality rates in accurately recorded human history. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Africa; Oceania         b(N37)  aU.S.; Liberia  aDisease  a Immigrant  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g29g4h581-94tDemography  iN  aNovember 199201715naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450098001601000025002581100015002835200748002986500044010466500077010906500076011676510021012436530014012646530015012786530017012936530016013106550020013267730031013468560006013779030018013830276779  a199306       199211                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aF22  aJ11  aJ1310aImmigrants' Ages and the Structure of Stationary Populations with Below-Replacement Fertility10aSchmertmann, Carl P.  aFL State U  aA sustained regime of low fertility plus immigration yields an unusual kind of stationary population. The author demonstrates that all stationary populations have a common structure, and that the familiar replacement-level fertility population is the youngest among the many stationary populations corresponding to a particular life table. This finding has important consequences for policy because although fertility increase and immigration are equally effective at halting population decline, immigration is inferior as a means of rejuvenating low-fertility populations. In fact, an immigration-based policy could make a low-fertility population older rather than younger. The paper includes examples using U.S. and West German vital rates. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.; W.

Long-term immigration is measured by the number of new immigrants (permanent resident aliens) arriving in the year, temporary migrant arrivals (nonimmigrants) who subsequently adjust to permanent resident status, arrivals of asylees and refugees, and nonimmigrants who arrive during the year and stay for more than twelve months before departing. The estimates of long-term immigration for 1983 are compared to official INS statistics on alien immigration. Significant differences emerge according to country of origin, age, and state of intended residence. A method of producing current estimates of long-term immigration is illustrated. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aAlien  a Demographics  a Immigrant  a Immigration  a Migrant  aJournal Article  g29g4h613-26tDemography  iN  aNovember 199201461naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450063001521000023002151100018002385200683002566500071009396500077010106510009010876530011010966530016011076550020011237730030011438560006011739030016011790273667  a199303       199208                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aH77  aJ1110aCensus Adjustment and the Distribution of Federal Spending10aMurray, Michael P.  aBates College  aIn 1989, programs that use population counts to determine the distribution of their funds transferred $236 per capita to state and local governments. If the 1990 census were adjusted to reflect undercounting, about 40 percent of state and local governments would receive increased grants averaging $56 per miscounted person; other jurisdictions would lose an almost equal amount of grant money. The surprisingly small reallocations arise because (1) total funds allocated by population are essentially fixed; (2) allocations depend on other factors in addition to population; and (3) programs vary as to whether they allocate funds in direct or inverse proportion to population. 4aIntergovernmental Relations; Federalism; Secession         b(H77) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Population  aJournal Article  g29g3h319-32tDemography  iN  aAugust 199201364naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450089001521000021002411100016002625200470002786500076007486500084008246510011009086530011009196530018009306530015009486530013009636530014009766550020009907730030010108560006010409030016010460273668  a199303       199208                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1211aAge of Entry into Marriage and the Date of the Initiation of Voluntary Birth Control10aCoale, Ansley J.  aPrinceton U  aIt is widely known that modern economic development has been accompanied by the initiation and spread of effective limitation of fertility, and that generally the populations which experienced development at a late date also had a belated reduction in childbearing.

This measure has broad applicability because it does not require information on marital fertility rates. When both the proportion of births by age 35 and the most commonly used measure of fertility control, "m", are calculated for a population over time, they are correlated very highly. Because of increasing levels of nonmarital fertility in several developed countries, measures of fertility control that are based on marital fertility are less appropriate now than in the past. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aDemographic Economics: Public Policy         b(J18)  aJapan; Sweden; Taiwan; U.S.S.R.  aBirths  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g29g3h343-56tDemography  iN  aAugust 199201608naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450088001441000022002327000021002541100014002757100009002895200851002986500084011496510009012336530012012426530016012546550020012707730030012908560006013209030016013260273670  a199303       199208                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1213aThe Relationship between Cohabitation and Divorce: Selectivity or Causal Influence?10aAxinn, William G.10aThornton, Arland  aU Chicago  aU MI  aRecent evidence linking premarital cohabitation to high rates of divorce poses a complex theoretical and empirical puzzle. The authors develop hypotheses predicting that premarital cohabitation is selective of those who are prone to divorce as well as hypotheses predicting that the experience of premarital cohabitation produces attitudes and values which increase the probability of divorce. Using multiwave panel data from a recent cohort of young men and women in the United States, they specify and test models of these predictions. The results are consistent with hypotheses suggesting that cohabitation is selective of men and women who are less committed to marriage and more approving of divorce. The results also are consistent with the conclusion that cohabiting experiences significantly increase young people's acceptance of divorce. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aDivorce  a Premarital  aJournal Article  g29g3h357-74tDemography  iN  aAugust 199201643naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450096001521000017002487000026002657000018002911100012003097100012003217100012003335200767003456500076011126500084011886510009012726550020012817730030013018560006013319030016013370273671  a199303       199208                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1210aFeathered Nest/Gilded Cage: Parental Income and Leaving Home in the Transition to Adulthood10aAvery, Roger10aGoldscheider, Frances10aSpeare, Alden  aBrown U  aBrown U  aBrown U  aThe growing study of leaving home in young adulthood in the United States has been hampered by data and measurement problems, which are producing a major theoretical confusion about the role of parental resources in influencing young adults' leaving home. Does high parental income retain young adults in the home or subsidize their leaving (and parental privacy)? This paper uses the 1984 panel of Survey of Income and Program Participation to clarify this issue, and shows that the effects of parental resources differ depending on the route out of the home under consideration (marriage or premarital residential independence) Effects change substantially over the nest-leaving ages, but relatively few differences are found between young men and young women. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g29g3h375-88tDemography  iN  aAugust 199202021naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450071001601000017002317000021002481100027002697100027002965200984003236500076013076500084013836500036014676510009015036530010015126530014015226530012015366530012015486530013015606530013015736550020015867730031016068560006016379030016016430273672  a199303       199208                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ12  aI1013aThe Effects of Child Health on Marital Status and Family Structure10aCorman, Hope10aKaestner, Robert  aRider College and NBER  aRider College and NBER  aThe purpose of this paper is to provide evidence on the effect of child health on marital stability and family structure in an economic framework. The authors use the 1988 National Health Interview Survey's Child Health Supplement, with a sample of about 9,000 families, to test whether having an unhealthy child decreases the mother's chance of being married and whether it increases her chance of living in an extended family. Using two different measures of child health, they find that having an unhealthy child decreases the mother's likelihood of being married. Their results imply that children in poor health are more likely to face obstacles beyond their illness because they also are more likely to suffer the consequences of poverty and the poor schooling outcomes that result from being raised in a female headed household. The only mitigating factor is that unhealthy white children are more likely than their healthy counterparts to be living in an extended family. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aHealth: General         b(I10)  aU.S.  aChild  a Families  a Family  a Health  a Marital  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g29g3h389-408tDemography  iN  aAugust 199201764naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450115001441000020002597000022002791100023003017100050003245200887003746500076012616510009013376530013013466530017013596530015013766530011013916550020014027730030014228560006014529030016014580273673  a199303       199208                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aDrug Use as a Risk Factor for Premarital Teen Pregnancy and Abortion in a National Sample of Young White Women10aMensch, Barbara10aKandel, Denise B.  aPopulation Council  aColumbia U and NY State Psychiatric Institute  aThe relationship between adolescent drug use and premarital teen pregnancy and abortion as a pregnancy outcome among sexually active women is investigated in a sample of white women from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Event history analysis is used to explore whether prior drug use has a unique effect on premarital teen pregnancy. with controls for personality, lifestyle, and biological factors. Logistic regression is used to estimate whether drug use affects the decision to terminate a premarital teen pregnancy. The results show that the risk of premarital teen pregnancy is nearly four times as high for those who have used illicit drugs other than marijuana as for those with no history of any prior substance involvement. Furthermore, illicit drug use increases the likelihood of an abortion by a factor of 5. Policy implications of the findings are discussed. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aAbortion  a Adolescents  a Pregnancy  a Youth  aJournal Article  g29g3h409-29tDemography  iN  aAugust 199201441naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450088001441000027002327000019002591100009002787100009002875200670002966500076009666510009010426530012010516530013010636530015010766550020010917730030011118560006011419030016011470273674  a199303       199208                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aWhy Are Teenagers in the United States Less Likely to Breast-Feed than Older Women?10aPeterson, Christine E.10aDaVanzo, Julie  aRAND  aRAND  aTeenage mothers are much less likely than older mothers to breastfeed their infants. The lower breastfeeding rate among teenagers aged 16-19, compared with women aged 20-29, is due almost entirely to the fact that teenage mothers tend to have characteristics associated with a lower likelihood of breastfeeding among all women, such as lowest educational level, lower income, and being unmarried. Even so, nearly 40 percent of the difference between teenage mothers aged 15 or less and mothers aged 20-29 remains unexplained by these factors and may be due to developmental aspects of adolescence, such as greater egocentricity and greater concern about body image. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aInfants  a Mothers  a Teenagers  aJournal Article  g29g3h431-50tDemography  iN  aAugust 199201810naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450077001521000025002291100009002545200966002636500113012296500100013426510009014426530009014516530012014606550020014727730030014928560006015229030016015280273675  a199303       199208                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aR2210aResidential Preferences and Residential Choices in a Multiethnic Context10aClark, William A. V.  aUCLA  aA study of the expressed preferences of four different ethnic groups in the Los Angeles metropolitan area shows strong desires for own-race combinations in the ethnicity of neighborhoods that individuals say they would choose when seeking a new residence. The results also show that Anglos are not the only group to practice "avoidance" of other racial/ethnic neighborhoods, although avoidance behavior by Anglos is the strongest. Because the issues of racial composition are socially sensitive, additional tests examined the relationship of preferences to behavior. Although many behaviors generally follow expressed preferences, members of households who expressed "no preference" also were found to largely choose own race neighborhoods. The results of this study suggest that the expressed preference for own race/own ethnicity, in combination with short-distance local moves, is likely to maintain present patterns of separation in U.S. metropolitan areas. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Other Demand         b(R22)  aU.S.  aRace  a Racial  aJournal Article  g29g3h451-66tDemography  iN  aAugust 199201909naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450072001521000021002241100015002455201065002606500102013256500113014276510009015406530012015496530010015616550020015717730030015918560006016219030016016270273676  a199303       199208                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aR21  aJ1510aRace and Ethnicity in Housing: Turnover in New York City, 1978-198710aRosenbaum, Emily  aColumbia U  aThis study examines the patterns and predictors of housing turnovers among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Puerto Ricans, and other Hispanics in New York City during 1978-87 to assess whether access to housing is distributed differentially by race and ethnicity. The data are taken from the biennial New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey. After controlling for household preferences, purchasing power, and quality characteristics of the housing unit, multinomial logistic regression results show the most consistent and significant predictors of turnover to be geographic and market-sector attributes. The findings suggest the presence of structural constraints in the housing market which effectively channel racial/ethnic groups to separate neighborhoods. The overall results are reminiscent of early studies of neighborhood transition by O. Duncan and B. Duncan (1957) and K. Taeuber and A. Taeuber (1965), and show that little progress has been made toward achieving equality in housing or informal social contact between racial/ethnic groups. 4aUrban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand         b(R21) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aHousing  a Race  aJournal Article  g29g3h467-86tDemography  iN  aAugust 199201933naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450097001601000025002577000018002827000023003001100015003237100018003387100014003565200910003706500044012806500064013246500065013886510017014536530016014706530013014866530015014996550020015147730030015348560006015649030013015700269583  a199212       199205                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aF22  aK42  aJ6110aStemming the Tide?

Data were collected from migrants interviewed in seven Mexican communities during the winters of 1987 through 1989, as well as from out-migrants from those communities who subsequently located in the United States. The authors conduct time-series experiments that examine changes in migrants' behavior before and after passage of the IRCA in 1986. They estimate trends in the probability of taking a first illegal trip, the probability of repeat migration, the probability of apprehension by the Border Patrol, the probability of using a border smuggler, and the costs of illegal border crossing. In none of these analyses could they detect any evidence that IRCA has significantly deterred undocumented migration from Mexico. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aIllegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law         b(K42) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.; Mexico  aImmigration  a Migrant  a Migration  aJournal Article  g29g2h139-57tDemography  iN  aMay 199201547naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450053001601000026002131100009002395200694002486500044009426500064009866500065010506510017011156530016011326530013011486530015011616550020011767730030011968560006012269030013012320269584  a199212       199205                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aF22  aK42  aJ6110aPlaying Cat and Mouse at the U.S.-Mexican Border10aKossoudji, Sherrie A.  aU MI  aBorder control and apprehension activity represents a major element of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.

The author explores these questions by testing hypotheses about the effects of apprehension on the actual and desired length of stay in the United States and on the frequency of migration for undocumented Mexican male migrants. Results suggest that INS policy may well be backfiring. Migrants stay in the United States longer on non-apprehended trips and stay in Mexico for shorter spells between trips to compensate for the cost of past apprehension. 4aInternational Migration         b(F22) 4aIllegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law         b(K42) 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aU.S.; Mexico  aImmigration  a Migrant  a Migration  aJournal Article  g29g2h159-80tDemography  iN  aMay 199201991naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450056001681000019002241100022002435201003002656500113012686500065013816500041014466500053014876510011015406530019015516530016015706530010015866550020015967730030016168560006016469030013016520269585  a199212       199205                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aJ31  aJ71  aJ2210aImmigrants, Visible Minorities, and Self-Employment10aMaxim, Paul S.  aU Western Ontario  aHistorically, self-employment was perceived as a mechanism whereby immigrants could circumvent discriminatory practices in wage labor. More recent research by G. Borjas (1985, 1986) in the United States, however, suggests that this view is incorrect. Immigrants, particularly members of visible minorities, are disadvantaged in both the wage labor and the self-employed markets. This pattern has not been replicated in Canada, however; after controlling for several socioeconomic attributes, it is found that foreign-born, self-employed visible minority-group members are not at a disadvantage in relation to the majority population. Foreign-born visible minority group members earn less, however, in the wage labor force. In contrast, it was found that there is no statistically significant difference between native-born visible minority group members and others in the wage labor force, and that native-born, self-employed minority-group members may earn more than others in that market segment. 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aWage Level and Structure; Wage Differentials         b(J31) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71) 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22)  aCanada  aDiscriminatory  a Minorities  a Wage  aJournal Article  g29g2h181-98tDemography  iN  aMay 199201633naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450062001521000023002147000023002377000022002601100042002827100009003247100042003335200632003756500076010076500077010836510009011606530014011696530011011836530016011946530015012106550020012257730031012458560006012769030013012820269586  a199212       199205                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1110aReligion and Fertility in the United States: New Patterns10aMosher, William D.10aWilliams, Linda B.10aJohnson, David P.  aNational Center for Health Statistics  aU MI  aNational Center for Health Statistics  aIn the United States, the baby boom-era pattern of high Catholic and low Protestant fertility has ended.

Future research on the demography of religious groups should focus on explaining the delayed marriage pattern of Catholics, the high fertility of Mormons and frequently attending Protestants, and the very low fertility of those with no religious affiliation. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aBaby Boom  a Child  a Demography  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g29g2h199-214tDemography  iN  aMay 199201473naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450094001521000027002461100009002735200641002826500076009236500079009996510009010786530010010876530014010976530015011116550020011267730030011468560006011769030013011820269587  a199212       199205                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aH3110aTaxes and the Family: The Impact of the Tax Exemption for Dependents on Marital Fertility10aWhittington, Leslie A.  aU MD  aIn this paper the author uses data from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics to examine the relationship between the dependent exemption feature of the United States federal income tax (an unambiguous subsidy to dependents) and the fertility behavior of married couples over the period 1979-1983. The exemption decreases the price of a child to a household, thus having a direct relationship to the timing and/or number of children observed in a family. Conditional logit results support this hypothesis by showing that the exemption has a positive and significant impact on the likelihood of having a birth during the period under study. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aFiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents: Household         b(H31)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g29g2h215-26tDemography  iN  aMay 199200673naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450041001441000022001857000018002071100009002257100032002346500076002666510009003426530011003516550020003627730030003828560006004129030013004180269588  a199212       199205                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1311aAge at Last Birth and Its Components10aSuchindran, C.

Measures of the quantity and "quality" of marriageable men simultaneously specific for women's age, race, education, and place of residence reveal especially poor marriage prospects for highly educated black women. The effect of mate availability on nonmarital fertility is generally modest. Among white women, marriage opportunities are associated inversely with the nonmarital fertility rate, perhaps reflecting an increased likelihood that a premarital conception will be legitimated. Marriage opportunities also reduce nonmarital fertility ratios for young black and white women. The nonmarital fertility rate is lower among women whose marriage pool includes a large percentage of nonemployed males. Only a small proportion of the racial difference in nonmarital fertility appears attributable to differences in the marriage markets of black and of white women. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aFertility  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g29g2h247-64tDemography  iN  aMay 199201834naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450095001441000022002391100044002615201101003056500076014066510009014826530017014916530015015086550020015237730030015438560006015739030013015790269590  a199212       199205                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aPersonality Traits and Developmental Experiences as Antecedents of Childbearing Motivation10aMiller, Warren B.  aTransnational Family Research Institute  aChildbearing motivation may be conceptualized as based upon psychological traits and shaped by experiences during childhood, adolescence, and early adult life. This paper explores what those traits and developmental experiences are. Two measures of childbearing motivation, one positive and the other negative, are described. Using a sample of 362 married men and 354 married women, the paper systematically examines the factors associated with these measures. In addition to a set of basic personality traits, these factors include parental characteristics, teenage experiences, a number of variables from young adult behavior domains such as marriage, education, work, religion, and parental relationships. Stepwise multiple regression analyses lead to two final constrained, simultaneous-equation regression models. These models indicate the importance of both personality traits and diverse life-cycle experiences in the development of childbearing motivation, the differential gender distribution of predictors, and the different experiential antecedents of positive and negative motivation. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChildbearing  a Childhood  aJournal Article  g29g2h265-85tDemography  iN  aMay 199201659naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450099001521000023002511100009002745200871002836500038011546500066011926510009012586530011012676530018012786530015012966550020013117730031013318560006013629030013013680269591  a199212       199205                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1610aLiving and Dying in the U.S.A.: Sociodemographic Determinants of Death among Blacks and Whites10aRogers, Richard G.  aU CO  aThis paper examines the demographic and social factors associated with differences in length of life by race. The results demonstrate that sociodemographic factors-age, sex, marital status, family size, and income-profoundly affect black and white mortality. Indeed, the racial gap in overall mortality could close completely with increased standards of living and improved lifestyles. Moreover, examining cause-specific mortality while adjusting for social factors shows that compared to whites, blacks have a lower mortality risk from respiratory diseases, accidents, and suicide; the same risk from circulatory diseases and cancer; and higher risks from infectious diseases, homicide, and diabetes. These results underscore the importance of examining social characteristics to understand more clearly the race differences in overall and cause-specific mortality. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Demographics  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g29g2h287-303tDemography  iN  aMay 199201508naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450072001521000020002241100016002445200696002606500076009566500038010326510028010706530011010986530011011096530014011206530015011346550020011497730030011698560006011999030013012050269592  a199212       199205                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aI1210aBirth Spacing and Child Mortality in Bangladesh and the Philippines10aMiller, Jane E.  aPrinceton U  aThis analysis uses data from Bangladesh and the Philippines to demonstrate that children who are born within 15 months of a preceding birth are 60 to 80 percent more likely than other children to die in the first two years of life, once the confounding effects of prematurity are removed.

It compares the reported prevalence of widowhood to estimates of widowhood based on the mortality of black men and on the ages of women at first marriage. It also compares the reported distributions of duration of first marriage to estimates based on mortality and on age at first marriage. It concludes that census reports are subject to serious error. Widowhood is overreported, and marital turnover appears to have been faster than implied by census reports. The prevalence of "own children" is used to confirm these conclusions and to suggest motivations for misreporting. 4aEconomic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: U.S.; Canada: Pre-1913         b(N31) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aMarital  a Marriage  aJournal Article  g29g1h1-15tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199201458naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450045001441000021001891100020002105200779002306500076010096510009010856530010010946530014011046530013011186550020011317730029011518560006011809030018011860266330  a199209       199202                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aSelf-Employment and Providing Child Care10aConnelly, Rachel  aBowdoin College  aThis paper considers self-employment and providing child care as occupational strategies that can lower the cost of child care. If the ability to care for one's own children while engaged in market work is important to mothers with young children, the author predicts that women with young children will be more likely to choose to be self-employed or to be a child care provider than women without young children. The analysis provides strong support for this hypothesis. The results show that the presence of young children is an important factor in choosing self-employment and in choosing to be a child care provider. Finally, simulations are presented which show that a woman's choice among these sectors is quite sensitive to the number and ages of her young children. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g29g1h17-29tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199201737naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450066001521000019002181100009002375201009002466500077012556500051013326530011013836530016013946550020014107730029014308560006014599030018014650266331  a199209       199202                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ1010aHeterogeneity and Selection in Multistate Population Analysis10aRogers, Andrei  aU CO  aIf one subgroup of individuals in a population has a higher death rate than the others, then over time the surviving population will include a larger share of those with the lower death rate. As a result, the aggregate average death rate for this increasingly more robust population will decline. This conclusion, however, can be drawn only for "nonrecurrent" events experienced by populations that do not exchange members with one another--that is, for "noninteracting" populations. Studies of changes in marital status, labor force activity, residential location, and active life, for example, all should focus on patterns of "recurrent" events among "interacting" populations (that is, multistate populations). Selection arising from heterogeneity will occur, but the consequences for average measures become unpredictable a priori. This paper explores such aspects of the selection effects of heterogeneity in multistate populations and illuminates some of their consequences for commonly used rates. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aDemographic Economics: General         b(J10)  aDeaths  a Population  aJournal Article  g29g1h31-38tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199200700naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450052001441000018001967000021002141100009002357100042002446500076002866510009003626530014003716550020003857730029004058560006004349030018004400266332  a199209       199202                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aIntergenerational Patterns of Teenage Fertility10aKahn, Joan R.10aAnderson, Kay E.  aU MD  aNational Center for Health Statistics 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aFertility  aJournal Article  g29g1h39-57tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199201626naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450084001521000026002361100015002625200683002776500076009606500084010366510009011206530017011296530015011466530014011616530013011756530014011886530012012026530013012146550020012277730029012478560006012769030018012820266333  a199209       199202                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1210aDiversity in Experiences of Parental Structure during Childhood and Adolescence10aWojtkiewicz, Roger A.  aLA State U  aThe proportion of children living in parental structures other than mother/father has increased in recent decades because of increased separation/divorce and greater prevalence of nonmarital childbearing.

The analysis illustrates the diversity by considering parental structure experiences given (1) mother-only family at birth, (2) mother/father family at birth and later parental marital disruption, and (3) parental structure at age 15. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aChildbearing  a Childhood  a Children  a Divorce  a Families  a Family  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g29g1h59-68tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199201654naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450059001521000017002117000021002281100014002497100009002635200786002726500108010586500066011666510013012326530010012456530013012556530011012686550020012797730029012998560006013289030018013340266334  a199209       199202                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ14  aJ1610aChanges in the Family Status of Elderly Women in Korea10aLee, Yean-Ju10aPalloni, Alberto  aU Chicago  aU WI  aAs a result of sharp declines in fertility and mortality, the aging of the Korean population has proceeded rapidly and is likely to continue in full force for some time. In societies such as Korea, where families traditionally have been the only efficient source of support for the elderly, an aging population poses a threat because families have fewer descendants available to care for increasing numbers of surviving elderly persons. The exact magnitude of the reduction in the supply of kin depends on details of the demographic trends and cannot be evaluated a priori. In this paper the authors use family-status life tables to assess the effects of changes in demographic processes on the family status of elderly women and to project trends in elderly women's family status. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aS.

The authors develop a conceptual framework composed of three sets of factors: availability of kin, economic and health feasibility, and cultural desirability. Their analyses show that household living arrangements among Hispanic and non-Hispanic females are more similar when they control for these three sets of factors, and that cultural desirability factors are particularly important. The likelihood that elderly Hispanic females will reside in an institution is actually decreased, however, when the authors control for these factors; this finding suggests a strong reluctance among Hispanics to use formal long-term care facilities. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15)  aU.S.  aElderly  a Female  aJournal Article  g29g1h93-112tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199201862naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450070001521000020002227000032002421100030002747100030003045200966003346500076013006500066013766510009014426530013014516530011014646530011014756550020014867730030015068560006015369030018015420266336  a199209       199202                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1610aUnderreporting of Abortion in Surveys of U.S. Women: 1976 to 198810aJones, Elise F.10aForrest, Jacqueline Darroch  aAlan Guttmacher Institute  aAlan Guttmacher Institute  aAlthough research on reproductive behavior depends heavily on information from surveys, abortions are characteristically underreported in such data. Estimates of the level of reporting are made for each of the recent major surveys of U.S. women: the 1976, 1982. and 1988 cycles of the National Survey of Family Growth, the 1976 and 1979 National Surveys of Young Women, and the National Longitudinal Surveys of World Experience of Youth. The estimates are based on comparisons with external counts of abortions taking place. The authors examine variation by characteristics of women, trends over time, and the possible effects of length of recall and of the way in which questions about abortion are asked. Abortion reporting is found to be highly deficient in all the surveys, although the level varies widely. Whites are more likely to report their abortions than nonwhites. Special, confidential questioning procedures hold promise for improving the results. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aAbortion  a Women  a Youth  aJournal Article  g29g1h113-26tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199201578naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450055001521000021002077000024002281100034002527100013002865200670002996500076009696500066010456510013011116530013011246530019011376530019011566530015011756550020011907730030012108560006012409030018012460266337  a199209       199202                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1611aA Method for Calculating Rates of Induced Abortion10aForeit, Karen G.10aNortman, Dorothy L.  aFutures Group, Washington, DC  aUnlisted  aAccurate measurement of induced abortion is necessary for understanding the fertility dynamics of a population and for making projections about the future. Changes in abortion rates can amplify or dampen the impact of changes in contraception. This paper presents a methodology for calculating marital induced abortion rates from observed marital fertility and contraceptive prevalence and for modeling the impact of substituting contraception for abortion on future fertility. The methodology is validated against observed abortion complications in three populations, and the impact of substituting contraception for abortion on expected fertility is demonstrated. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aS.

First, the likelihood that childless women over age 30 will have a first birth has increased since the 1970s. This change shows that women born in the 1950s are "catching up" on fertility postponed at younger ages. Second, racial differences in the timing of first births are very large. For those born in the 1950s, nonwhites have first births much earlier, and far fewer nonwhite than white women will remain permanently childless. In the second part of the paper, they use these data for recent years to assess earlier projections of childlessness based on cohort and period approaches. They also assess the accuracy of stated intentions to have no children. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aBirths  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g28g4h513-33tDemography  iN  aNovember 199101225naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450066001521000020002181100022002385200375002606500160006356500076007956510012008716530014008836550020008977730030009178560006009479030018009530262800  a199206       199111                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aN33  aJ1310aNew Evidence on the Fertility Transition in Ireland 1880-191110aO Grada, Cormac  aU College, Dublin  aRecent analyses of Ireland's marital fertility transition based on the Princeton [I subscript g] and the Stanford CPA measures are reassessed.

In addition, current legal status is more important for predicting stability of union than is legal status at the initiation of the union. They also find that the effect of current legal status remains constant over various durations of unions and that legalizing a nonlegal union has little effect beyond that expected on the basis of occupying a particular legal status. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aBasic Areas of Law: Other         b(K19)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g28g4h571-86tDemography  iN  aNovember 199101429naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450087001441000022002317000019002531100015002727100014002875200686003016500084009876510016010716530013010876550020011007730031011208560006011519030018011570262803  a199206       199111                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1210aPatterns of Entry into Cohabitation and Marriage among Mainland Puerto Rican Women10aLandale, Nancy S.10aForste, Renata  aPA State U  aU Chicago  aThis paper adds to our limited knowledge of racial and ethnic variation in union formation by describing and analyzing the first unions of mainland Puerto Rican women. Retrospective history data show that Puerto Ricans have shared in the post-1970 shift toward cohabitation. Puerto Rican women, however, are much more likely to enter informal first unions than the general population, and have a low propensity to transform informal unions into legal marriages. This paper examines the influence of family background and current activities on union timing and type. The relationship between partner attributes and the choice between formal and informal coupling is also considered. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aPuerto Rico  aMarriage  aJournal Article  g28g4h587-607tDemography  iN  aNovember 199101632naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450063001521000023002157000025002381100016002637100016002795200754002956500084010496500076011336510009012096530010012186530015012286530013012436550020012567730030012768560006013069030018013120262804  a199206       199111                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1313aThe Use of Own-Child Checks to Determine Remarriage Status10aBoozer, Michael A.10aGuinnane, Timothy W.  aPrinceton U  aPrinceton U  aThe 1900 Federal Census of the United States did not ask currently-married women whether they had been married previously. This note uses the direct report on remarriage in the 1910 census to evaluate the performance of the "own-child checks" that several researchers have used with the 1900 census to substitute for direct information on remarriage. Accurate information on remarriage status is important for fertility and mortality estimation methods that rely on marital duration. The checks detect fewer than two-thirds of wives who report they are remarried. The use of these checks, however, does not introduce large amounts of error in an analysis of either fertility or mortality. The checks work better for white women than for black women. 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Fertility  a Marital  aJournal Article  g28g4h609-17tDemography  iN  aNovember 199101535naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450047001521000019001991100009002185200802002276500038010296500084010676510009011516530020011606530015011806550020011957730030012158560006012459030018012510262805  a199206       199111                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ1211aAre Cohort Mortality Rates Autocorrelated?10aFoster, Andrew  aU PA  aIn this paper the author examines the proposition that heterogeneity in individual frailty leads to autocorrelation in cohort mortality rates. A simple model is used to construct analytic expressions for the covariance of cohort mortality rates at different ages under a number of alternative assumptions about the stochastic process generating shocks in mortality. The model then is used to construct a procedure that uses correlations in cohort mortality rates to estimate the extent of heterogeneity in a population without relying on strong assumptions about the distribution of frailty or the shape of the underlying hazard. The procedure then is used to show that cohort mortality data from France are consistent with a generalized random-effects model in which frailty is gamma-distributed. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aMortality Rates  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g28g4h619-37tDemography  iN  aNovember 199101905naa  2200337   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001522450082001601000020002427000023002621100009002857100009002945200930003036500038012336500076012716500077013476510009014246530011014336530013014446530021014576530015014786550020014937730030015138560006015439030018015490262806  a199206       199111                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI12  aJ13  aJ1110aSpanish Surname and Anglo Infant Mortality: Differentials over a Half-Century10aForbes, Douglas10aFrisbie, W. Parker  aU TX  aU TX  aUsing a half-century of death records from San Antonio/Bexar County, Texas, the authors examine the timing and cause structure of Spanish surname and Anglo infant mortality. Their findings show that despite the substantial disparities between ethnic-specific infant mortality rates in the early years of the study, there have been consistent declines in overall, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality for both groups, as well as a major convergence of mortality rates between Spanish surname and Anglo infants. Further, they demonstrate that the convergence is of relatively recent origin and is due primarily to shifts in postneonatal mortality. Finally, they examine the transition reflected in the cause structure of ethnic-specific infant mortality and show that the convergence was largely the result of reductions in deaths from exogenous causes. Implications for research into the "epidemiologic paradox" are discussed. 4aHealth Production         b(I12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aDeaths  a Infants  a Mortality Rates  a Mortality  aJournal Article  g28g4h639-60tDemography  iN  aNovember 199101845naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450066001521000019002187000022002371100009002597100012002685200913002806500053011936500076012466510009013226530010013316530014013416530015013556530018013706530013013886530011014016530011014126550020014237730030014438560006014739030016014790251709  a199203       199108                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ22  aJ1310aChild Care Demand and Labor Supply of Young Mothers over Time10aBlau, David M.10aRobins, Philip K.  aU NC  aU Miami  aThis paper uses panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to analyze jointly fertility, employment, and child care decisions of young women over time. As these young women age (form 21 to 25 years on average) they become increasingly likely to have young children, to be employed, and to use nonrelative forms of child care. A multivariate analysis reveals that rising wage rates and changes in household structure are important determinants of these upward trends. Further analysis reveals a considerable amount of movement each year among states defined by the presence of young children, employment, and child care arrangement. Overall the young women in the NLSY can be characterized as being in a volatile stage of their lives, when many economic and demographic factors are changing. They appear to respond to these changes by altering their labor supply and child care behavior. 4aTime Allocation and Labor Supply         b(J22) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Children  a Fertility  a Labor Supply  a Mothers  a Women  a Youth  aJournal Article  g28g3h333-51tDemography  iN  aAugust 199101254naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450123001521000027002751100015003025200371003176500084006886500066007726510018008386530024008566530013008806530011008936550020009047730030009248560006009549030016009600251710  a199203       199108                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1610aWife or Frau, Women Do Worse: A Comparison of Men and Women in the United States and Germany after Marital Dissolution10aBurkhauser, Richard V.  aSyracuse U  aLongitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the German Socio-Economic Panel show that in the Federal Republic of Germany, women experience even sharper drops in economic status immediately after a marital split than in the United States, while German and American men fare about the same.

Applications of these models, however, are based for the most part on cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data. In this paper the authors examine living arrangements in later life among the nonmarried population aged 55 and over, using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation. They observe individuals as they change living arrangements, die, or become institutionalized. Their results suggest that economic resources dominate the decision-making process in transitions across different household arrangements, whereas health is most important in explaining institutionalization. 4aEconomics of the Elderly; Economics of the Handicapped; Non-labor Market Discrimination         b(J14)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g28g3h375-90tDemography  iN  aAugust 199101341naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450044001441000022001887000021002101100009002317100020002405200651002606500076009116530014009876530013010016550020010147730031010348560006010659030016010710251713  a199203       199108                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aCorrelations between Frequencies of Kin10aPullum, Thomas W.10aWolf, Douglas A.  aU TX  aUrban Institute  aRecent years have seen the development of formal and microsimulation models of the structure and dynamics of kin networks. These models generally assume uncorrelated fertility within and across generations. Several sets of real data, however, show positive correlations between the frequencies of various categories of kin. This paper uses formal models to calculate the correlations that will exist between certain categories of kin even if mothers and daughters have independent fertility. Mechanisms by which fertility might be transmitted from mothers to their daughters are considered and the implications for kin correlations are evaluated. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aFertility  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g28g3h391-409tDemography  iN  aAugust 199100626naa  2200217   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450065001441000021002091100009002306500077002396510009003166530011003256550020003367730030003568560006003869030016003920251714  a199203       199108                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1113aThe New Census Question about Ancestry: What Did It Tell Us?10aFarley, Reynolds  aU MI 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aU.S.  aCensus  aJournal Article  g28g3h410-29tDemography  iN  aAugust 199101954naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450097001521000021002497000019002701100017002897100017003065201107003236500113014306500041015436510009015846530011015936550020016047730030016248560006016549030016016600251715  a199203       199108                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aJ7110aVariations on Two Themes: Racial and Ethnic Patterns in the Attainment of Suburban Residence10aAlba, Richard D.10aLogan, John R.  aSUNY, Albany  aSUNY, Albany  aTo investigate racial and ethnic diversity in suburbanization, the authors draw on two complementary theoretical traditions, which they label "assimilation" and "stratification." Their analytic model is multilevel, and includes variables characterizing individuals, households, and metropolitan contexts. They use it to analyze the determinants of suburban versus central-city residence for 11 racial/ethnic groups. The analysis reveals that family status, socioeconomic, and assimilation variables influence the suburbanization process rather consistently. They take this finding as evidence in favor of the assimilation model. These effects display group variations, however, in a manner predicted by the stratification model. There are also suburbanization differences among metropolitan areas, particularly related to the relative economic status of cities and their suburbs, and between the northeast/north central regions and the south/west. Finally, they conclude that suburbanization is variable across the groups in a way that is not captured by broad categories such as "Asian" or "Hispanic." 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aLabor Discrimination         b(J71)  aU.S.  aRacial  aJournal Article  g28g3h431-53tDemography  iN  aAugust 199100717naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450080001441000019002247000018002431100031002617100031002926500077003236530015004006550020004157730030004358560006004659030016004710251716  a199203       199108                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1110aMovement toward Stability as a Fundamental Principle of Population Dynamics10aSchoen, Robert10aKim, Young J.  aJohns Hopkins U, Baltimore  aJohns Hopkins U, Baltimore 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aPopulation  aJournal Article  g28g3h455-66tDemography  iN  aAugust 199101692naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450073001441000021002171100029002385200944002676500076012116510011012876530011012986530014013096530015013236530016013386550020013547730030013748560006014049030016014100251717  a199203       199108                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aFertility Decline in Taiwan: A Study Using Parity Progression Ratios10aFeeney, Griffith  aE-W Population Institute  aTaiwan's decline in fertility is studied by using period parity progression ratios. Levels of marriage and motherhood are found to have been high and essentially constant through the late 1980s, suggesting that the decline has been due almost entirely to declines in second and higher order-births. Families with three or more children play an important role in maintaining the current level of fertility. The level of fertility would be even lower without these families. They contributed more than one-half child per woman to the total fertility rate during most of the 1980s. Total fertility rates computed from the period parity progression ratios indicate a substantially higher level of fertility than the conventional total fertility rate; they remained above or at replacement level through 1988. A formal demographic analysis suggests that the conventional total fertility rate has been depressed by shifts in age at childbearing. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aTaiwan  aBirths  a Children  a Fertility  a Motherhood  aJournal Article  g28g3h467-79tDemography  iN  aAugust 199100707naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450081001521000021002331100013002546500051002676500084003186510009004026550020004117730027004318560006004589030013004640247956  a199112       199105                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ10  aJ1210aCorrections [A Flexible Approach for the Decomposition of Rate Differences].10aLiao, Tim Futing  aUnlisted 4aDemographic Economics: General         b(J10) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g28g2h179tDemography  iN  aMay 199101465naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450087001521000021002391100009002605200648002696500076009176500038009936510016010316530021010476530012010686530013010806530013010936550020011067730030011268560006011569030013011620247957  a199112       199105                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aI1210aInfluences on the Extent of Breast-Feeding: A Prospective Study in the Philippines10aStewart, John F.  aU NC  aThere has been much controversy about the impact of the health sector and the infant food industry on breast-feeding behavior. This study links causal factors to breast-feeding decisions, using a longitudinal survey of more than 3,000 Filipino mother-infant pairs. Most factors decreasing the likelihood that mothers will breast-feed seem to be related to family economics. Delivery in a private hospital, urban residence, high income, absence of spouse, and having worked for wages affect adversely the initiation of breast-feeding. Formula advertising and distribution of samples appear to have relatively little impact on feeding decisions. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aHealth Production         b(I12)  aPhilippines  aFamily Economics  a Health  a Infants  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g28g2h181-99tDemography  iN  aMay 199100722naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450063001521000020002151100020002356500077002556500059003326510009003916530011004006550020004117730030004318560006004619030013004670247958  a199112       199105                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aD1210aCensus Monographs on Family, Work, and Money: Review Essay10aCherlin, Andrew  aJohns Hopkins U 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aConsumer Economics: Empirical Analysis         b(D12)  aU.S.  aCensus  aJournal Article  g28g2h201-11tDemography  iN  aMay 199101599naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450057001521000020002091100049002295200801002786500084010796500076011636510025012396530012012646550020012767730030012968560006013269030013013320247959  a199112       199105                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1310aEstimation of Mortality from Orphanhood in Adulthood10aTimaeus, Ian M.  aLondon School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine  aThis paper extends earlier research into methods for estimating adult mortality from information on the recent incidence of orphanhood. It presents a series of regression coefficients for estimating female and male mortality form synthetic cohort data on the subsequent orphanhood of those who had a living mother or father at exact age 20. Such information can be obtained either where questions about parental survival have been asked in two inquiries or by asking retrospectively about dates of orphanhood in a single survey. Although the method is somewhat sensitive to errors in the reporting of ages and dates, it is a promising source of up-to-date estimates of adult mortality that are free from bias due to the underreporting of the orphanhood of young children (" the adoption effect"). 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aMalawi; Peru; Uganda  aMothers  aJournal Article  g28g2h213-27tDemography  iN  aMay 199101590naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450098001521000017002507000017002671100022002847100009003065200716003156500076010316500084011076510011011916530014012026530015012166550020012317730030012518560006012819030013012870247960  a199112       199105                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1210aIndividual-Level Sterility: A New Method of Estimation with Application to Sub-Saharan Africa10aLarsen, Ulla10aMenken, Jane  aSUNY, Stony Brook  aU PA  aThis paper extends work on measures of population proportions sterile to propose a new estimator of an individual women's age at sterility and and consequently her sterility status at given ages. Accuracy and reliability, examined in a simulation study, appear satisfactory. From World Fertility Survey data for five African countries, the proportions sterile by age estimated by the individual measure and by the population estimator are almost identical. Cameroon and Kenya show substantial variation in prevalence and incidence of sterility across ethnic groups and by number of marriages. Unexpectedly, the evidence suggests that sterility increased from 1960 on in Kenya and remained unchanged in Cameroon. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aAfrica  aFertility  a Sterility  aJournal Article  g28g2h229-47tDemography  iN  aMay 199101587naa  2200253   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450111001441000023002551100042002785200813003206500076011336510011012096530011012206530018012316530015012496550020012647730030012848560006013149030013013200247961  a199112       199105                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1313aThe Effect of Imputation Procedures on First Birth Intervals: Evidence from Five African Fertility Surveys10aMeekers, Dominique  aNational Research Council, Washington  aIn most African societies there is little motivation to remember dates of demographic events with the level of precision required in demographic surveys. Consequently, it is common that the large majority of survey respondents can provide only the calendar year of occurrence or their age at the time of the event. The World Fertility Survey Groups decided to handle the problem of poor date reporting by using a computer program to impute the missing information. This article illustrates the effect of these imputation procedures on cross-national differentials in the proportion of premarital first births in Benin, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria. The analysis demonstrates that the exceptionally low proportion of premarital first births in Ghana is an artifact of the imputation procedures. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aAfrica  aBirths  a Demographics  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g28g2h249-60tDemography  iN  aMay 199101636naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450100001441000022002447000019002661100009002857100011002945200928003056500077012336530015013106550020013257730030013458560006013759030013013810247962  a199112       199105                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1111aAn Empirical Analysis of the Effect of Length of Forecast Horizon on Population Forecast Errors10aSmith, Stanley K.10aSincich, Terry  aU FL  aU S FL  aMany studies have found that population forecast errors generally increase with the length of the forecast horizon, but none have examined this relationship in detail. Do errors grow linearly, exponentially, or in some other manner as the forecast horizon becomes longer? Does the error-horizon relationship differ by forecasting technique, launch year, size of place, or rate of growth? Do alternative measures of error make a difference? In this article, we address these questions using two simple forecasting techniques and population data from 1900 to 1980 for states in the United States. We find that in most instances there is a linear or nearly linear relationship between forecast accuracy and the length of the forecast horizon, but no consistent relationship between bias and the length of the horizon. We believe that these results provide useful information regarding the nature of population forecast errors. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aPopulation  aJournal Article  g28g2h261-74tDemography  iN  aMay 199100715naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450052001441000021001967000022002177000018002391100012002577100012002697100012002816500065002936510010003586530012003686550020003807730030004008560006004309030013004360247963  a199112       199105                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ6110aTemporary Migrants in Shanghai Households, 198410aGoldstein, Alice10aGoldstein, Sidney10aGuo, Shenyang  aBrown U  aBrown U  aBrown U 4aGeographic Labor Mobility; Immigrant Workers         b(J61)  aChina  aMigrant  aJournal Article  g28g2h275-91tDemography  iN  aMay 199100889naa  2200265   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450100001521000021002527000016002731100016002897100057003056500084003626500077004466510010005236530020005336550020005537730031005738560006006049030013006100247964  a199112       199105                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ12  aJ1113aThe Effect of Age Misreporting in China on the Calculation of Mortality Rates at Very High Ages10aCoale, Ansley J.10aLi, Shaomin  aPrinceton U  aAT&T Business Operations Analysis, Basking Ridge, NJ 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12) 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11)  aChina  aMortality Rates  aJournal Article  g28g2h293-301tDemography  iN  aMay 199101442naa  2200289   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450093001521000021002451100014002665200588002806500113008686500038009816510009010196530011010286530013010396530019010526530012010716550020010837730030011038560006011339030013011390247965  a199112       199105                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ15  aI1210aSocioeconomic Determinants of White and Black Males' Life Expectancy Differentials, 198010aPotter, Lloyd B.  aFordham U  aEpidemiological transition theory suggests that two populations existing under disparite socioeconomic conditions would have different life expectancies as the result of the cause-of-death differences.

We decompose the total poverty rate change over the 1976-83 period into components attributable to changes in employment shares and changes in the incidence of poverty within industries. Our results show that the poverty rate increase resulted primarily from the decline in employment rates in general and from increases in the incidence of poverty within all industries, rather than from the shift of employment opportunities between sectors. The growth of service sector employment in particular has not contributed to the increased incidence of poverty in the United States. 4aMeasurement and Analysis of Poverty         b(I32)  aU.S.  aJournal Article  g28g2h323-32tDemography  iN  aMay 199101840naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450107001681000020002751100009002955200805003046500077011096500081011866500113012676500066013806510009014466530011014556550020014667730028014868560006015149030018015200247946  a199112       199102                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aR12  aJ15  aJ1610aResidential Preferences and Neighborhood Racial Segregation: A Test of the Schelling Segregation Model10aClark, W.

The preference/tolerance schedules that are derived from the data have a different functional form from that suggested by Schelling, but confirm the view that stable integrated equilibria are unlikely. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aSize and Spatial Distributions of Regional Economic Activity         b(R12) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16)  aU.S.  aRacial  aJournal Article  g28g1h1-19tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199101840naa  2200361   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450054001681000020002227000019002421100015002617100009002765200726002856500077010116500066010886500113011546500081012676510009013486530011013576530012013686530012013806530013013926550020014057730029014258560006014549030018014600247947  a199112       199102                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ16  aJ15  aR1210aIs Neighborhood Racial Succession Place-Specific?10aLee, Barrett A.10aWood, Peter B.  aPA State U  aU OK  aThis paper evaluates the geographic generality of the succession model of neighborhood racial change for the period 1970 to 1980. Using census data on racially mixed tracts, we determine whether white-to-black compositional shifts were equally common across the four regions and 58 central cities in our sample. Substantial variation occurred by region in the incidence and magnitude of racial succession; tracts in western cities departed most markedly from expectations. Even in other regions, some cities experienced more numerous instances of stability and displacement than of succession. These region and city effects persist when neighborhood characteristics believed to influence racial transition are controlled. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aSize and Spatial Distributions of Regional Economic Activity         b(R12)  aU.S.  aCensus  a Cities  a Racial  a Regions  aJournal Article  g28g1h21-40tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199101806naa  2200325   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001440430008001520430008001602450099001681000021002677000023002881100017003117100019003285200703003476500077010506500113011276500066012406500081013066510009013876530011013966550020014077730029014278560006014569030018014620247948  a199112       199102                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ15  aJ16  aR1210aPatterns of Neighborhood Transition in a Multiethnic World: U.S. Metropolitan Areas: 1970-198010aDenton, Nancy A.10aMassey, Douglas S.  aSUNY, Albany  aNORC/U Chicago  aEthnic diversity within metropolitan neighborhoods increased during the 1970s, and all-white tracts became less common. The simple presence of a minority group did not precipitate turnover, but as the minority proportion rose, the probability of racial and ethnic transition increased. Tracts with multiple groups became much more common during the decade and were especially prone to transition. Distinctively, black neighborhoods displayed a bipolar clustering at both ends of the distribution of minority presence. Multivariate models showed that white loss was increased by the presence of multiple minority groups, by a higher minority proportion, and by location near existing minority areas. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aEconomics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J15) 4aEconomics of Gender; Non-labor Discrimination         b(J16) 4aSize and Spatial Distributions of Regional Economic Activity         b(R12)  aU.S.  aRacial  aJournal Article  g28g1h41-63tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199101614naa  2200229   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450086001441000024002301100009002545200940002636500076012036530013012796530019012926550020013117730029013318560006013609030018013660247949  a199112       199102                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aIncreasing Contraceptive Use in Bangladesh: The Role of Demand and Supply Factors10aDeGraff, Deborah S.  aU NC  aThis article analyzes the determinants of contraceptive use in Bangladesh, focusing on the roles of demand for additional children and of family planning service supply. Data from the Matlab Family Planning Health Services Project are used to examine the contributions of these factors to the difference in prevalence of modern contraceptive use between the project area and a control area served by the government family planning and health programs. Results of multivariate analysis deriving from the Easterlin systhesis framework show the importance of family planning supply factors in reducing psychic and resource costs of fertility regulation and in activating latent demand for contraception. Demand for birth limiting and for birth spacing emerge as important explanatory factors; demand for birth spacing is greater in the project area, and both demand measures exert a stronger effect on contraceptive behavior in that area. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aChildren  a Contraceptive  aJournal Article  g28g1h65-81tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199101337naa  2200241   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450058001441000019002021100058002215200616002796500076008956530018009716530018009896530015010076550020010227730029010428560006010719030018010770247950  a199112       199102                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ1310aTrends and Determinants of Contraceptive Use in Kenya10aNjohu, Wamucii  aInstitute for Resource Development/Macro Systems, Inc  aThis study uses the 1977-78 Kenya Fertility Survey and the 1989 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey to examine trends and determinants of contraceptive use in Kenya. A substantial increase in contraceptive use occurred in Kenya over the decade. Yet although the increase was shared by all groups in the country, the amount of change differed greatly. A regression decomposition procedure revealed that shifts in population composition--that is, an increase in better educated women and in the proportion of women who want to cease childbearing--were the primary sources of aggregate change in contraceptive use. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aContraceptive  a Demographics  a Fertility  aJournal Article  g28g1h83-99tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199101896naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450044001521000017001967000024002137000020002371100009002577100044002667100009003105201013003196500076013326500084014086510014014926530014015066550020015207730030015408560006015709030018015760247951  a199112       199102                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ13  aJ1210aPregnancy Avoidance and Coital Behavior10aTsui, Amy O.10ade Silva, S.

We discuss the utility of the design, which is similar to that of an epidemiological surveillance system, for the measurement of coital behavior and pregnancy risk perceptions. Perceptions of pregnancy risk, spousal agreement on sexual relations, menstrual and lactational status, and cycle timing, all measured daily, are found to influence significantly the probability of coitus on that day. The findings suggest that substantial gains in studying fertility regulation are likely from closer investigation of the behavioral connections between motivation for pregnancy avoidance and coital incidence. Comparison of such panel data with those of cross-sectional sample surveys also provides insights into the validity of measures of coital and contraceptive behavior. 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13) 4aMarriage; Marital Dissolution; Family Structure; Domestic Abuse         b(J12)  aSri Lanka  aPregnancy  aJournal Article  g28g1h101-17tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199101554naa  2200301   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450086001521000017002387000022002551100009002777100029002865200691003156500042010066500076010486530010011246530014011346530015011486530015011636550020011787730030011988560006012289030018012340247952  a199112       199102                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ1310aFamily Size and Children's Education in Thailand: Evidence from a National Sample10aKnodel, John10aWongsith, Malinee  aU MI  aChulalongkorn U, Bangkok  aAnalysis of a large, nationally representative survey shows that family size exerts a substantial negative influence on the probability that a child will attend secondary school in Thailand. The primary mechanism underlying this effect is most likely the dilution of familial resources available per child associated with larger numbers of children. The extent and level of schooling at which this effect operates vary with the household level of wealth and with rural or urban residence. Because fertility decline is leading to a major increase in the proportion of children who come from small families, falling birth rates contribute to increasing educational attainment in Thailand. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aChild  a Children  a Education  a Schooling  aJournal Article  g28g1h119-31tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199101728naa  2200349   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450074001521000020002267000019002467000021002651100009002867100009002957100011003045200795003156500042011106500076011526510009012286530010012376530015012476530014012626530015012766530013012916550020013047730030013248560006013549030018013600247953  a199112       199102                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI21  aJ1310aChildhood Events and Circumstances Influencing High School Completion10aHaveman, Robert10aWolfe, Barbara10aSpaulding, James  aU WI  aU WI  aUS GAO  aThis paper is an empirical exploration of the effects of a variety of family and economic circumstances experienced during childhood on one indicator of success in young adulthood--high school completion. The estimates suggest that parental education and mother's work are positive and significant determinants of high school completion, whereas growing up in a family with more children (who compete for resources), being persistently poor and on welfare, and moving one's residence as a child have significant negative impacts on high school completion. The effects of some family stress and economic events differ depending on the age of the child when they occur. The results support the economic model of investment in children, as well as the welfare culture and socialization models. 4aAnalysis of Education         b(I21) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aU.S.  aChild  a Childhood  a Children  a Education  a Mothers  aJournal Article  g28g1h133-57tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199101606naa  2200313   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001360430008001442450057001521000018002097000019002277000022002461100020002687100020002887100020003085200689003286500077010176500076010946530017011706530015011876530016012026550020012187730030012388560006012689030018012740247954  a199112       199102                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aJ11  aJ1310aMomentum and the Growth-Free Segment of a Population10aKim, Young J.10aSchoen, Robert10aSarma, P.

Here we first present a new relationship for the momentum of any observed population as the ratio of (1) the proportion of the observed population under the mean age at childbearing to (2) the proportion of its life tabel population under that mean age. We then use that relationship to demonstrate Preston's approximation. Growth factors for other population segments are also presented. When the initial population is stable, momentum can be approximated as a function of thenet reproduction rate alone. 4aDemographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts         b(J11) 4aFertility; Family Planning; Child Care; Children; Youth         b(J13)  aChildbearing  a Fertility  a Population  aJournal Article  g28g1h159-73tDemography  iN  aFebruary 199101320naa  2200277   45000010008000000050011000080080044000190220013000630370060000760430008001362450063001441000020002077000025002277000023002521100009002757100009002847100009002935200602003026500038009046530011009426530015009536550020009687730030009888560006010189030018010240247955  a199112       199102                        eng     a00703370  nhttp://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13524  aI1210aUsing Surname Data in U.S. Puerto Rican Mortality Analysis10aRosenwaike, Ira10aHempstead, Katherine10aRogers, Richard G.  aU PA  aU PA  aU CO  aEvidence suggests that among mainland-born decedents, Hispanic (particularly Puerto Rican) origin may have been underreported in states that have added an ancestry item to their death certificates.
